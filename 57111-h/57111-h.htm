</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of L. C. Graves was taken at 10:30 a.m., on March 24, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Burt W. Griffin, assistant counsel of the President’s
Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am a member of the advisory staff of the General Counsel of
the President’s Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy. The
Commission has been given authority under a congressional resolution to investigate
the facts surrounding the death of President Kennedy and the killing of
Lee Harvey Oswald, and, other related events.</p>

<p>We are interested particularly, in calling you, in the events that surrounded
the death of Lee Harvey Oswald. We are also interested in everything that you
may know and so, you can consider relevant any question having to do with the
complete scope of the investigation. Now, you have the right to receive, by mail,
the notice 3 days in advance before the taking your testimony, and I want to
ask you at this time whether you waive that notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes; I waive that notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you also have a right to be present here with an attorney,
and, of course, you are not represented by counsel. If you would like the
opportunity to get an attorney, we’ll afford you that chance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No; I don’t think that is necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you state for the record your name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. My name is L. C. Graves [spelling] G-r-a-v-e-s.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where do you live, Mr. Graves?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I live at 7811 Maxwell Avenue, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And where are you employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I am employed with the Dallas Police Department, as a detective
in the homicide and robbery bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been with the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. 14 years, the 31st day of October last.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. October 8, 1918, at Camp County.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you been interviewed by me previous to this deposition
which we are now taking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you state for the record when it was that you and I
talked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Oh, approximately 30 minutes ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We have been talking almost continuously since that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, now, I will indicate for the record that we have been
discussing the—your experiences from the time President Kennedy was shot
until you arrived for work on Sunday morning, November 24, and I believe you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
told me while I was interviewing you that on Sunday morning you drove to work,
and that you parked your car somewhere along the side of the police department
building, and it is your recollection that you walked from the Commerce Street
side through the basement hall that leads to the records room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I asked you in the interview whether you remember just—remembered
just as you walked down from the Commerce Street—down the
steps to the door which leads into the building, whether as you got inside the
building you noticed the placement of TV cables in relationship to the engineroom,
or that door that goes back down into the subbasement. Do you have any
recollection of how the TV cables were spread out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Vaguely. I think the cables did go through that door. I couldn’t
be sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Which door are you talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Through the engineroom door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you got inside the building, where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I went to the homicide and robbery bureau on the third floor,
room 317.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you got up into the hallway on the third floor, can you
describe the condition of the hallway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, of course, it was cluttered up with camera equipment and
cables and newspeople, cameramen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember when you arrived there on the third floor,
whether the TV cameras were manned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Reasonably sure they were. There were men standing around
with earphones on and the light.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you recall about what time it was that you got up there
to the third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Approximately 8 o’clock, I think <span class="locked">or——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is in the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do when you got to the homicide bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, I went in, of course, and started answering the telephones
and talking to people that were calling about various things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was anybody else there when you arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes; just about everyone, I think, that worked in the homicide
bureau were there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who would that be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Oh, of course, my partner, L. D. <span class="locked">Montgomery——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Montgomery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. E. R. Beck, C. N. Dhority, J. R. Leavelle, C. W. Brown, Lieutenant
Wells, those are the ones that I remember right now at the moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember if Captain Fritz was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, yes; he was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember whether or not, Lee Oswald was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. He wasn’t there when I first got there in the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you got into the room, do you remember talking with
anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I don’t remember who I talked with first, when I got there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember having any conversation with anyone regardless
of who it might have been, after you got up there, shortly after you arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, the only conversation I recall actually, is when we were
told to bring him down, Oswald down to the captain’s office. Now, the rest was
routine stuff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long after you arrived would be your best estimate that
you were told to bring Oswald down to the captain’s office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, let’s see, we would have a thing to show the exact time that
I signed him out. At somewhere shortly before 10 o’clock, which would be
something over an hour, better part of 2 <span class="locked">hours——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In this period from approximately 8 o’clock until shortly before
10, did you have any conversations about the movement of Lee Oswald from the
city jail to the county jail?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, the captain told us that he would be transferred in a car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Captain Fritz told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes; and at first he wanted to talk to him some more, so, we
brought him down to the office so he could be interviewed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Captain Fritz tell you what kind of a car he was going to
be transferred in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes; we understood it was going to be a regular police car like
we use, plain cars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long before you got Oswald down did you get this information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Oh, it couldn’t have been but a few minutes, at least.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where were you told this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. In the hallway, or office there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall now whether you were in that homicide office or in
the hallway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I believe I was in the hallway when I heard it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many other officers were standing around at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Oh, I don’t remember really. Probably two or three or four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How close was Captain Fritz to you when you heard this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. As close as you and I are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We have a table separating us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. 6-foot, about a 6-foot table, isn’t it? Was he talking only to
you, or talking to the other officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Generally to all of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, at this time, were there newspaper people in the area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I don’t believe. At the moment, I don’t believe any newsmen
were in there at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This is not in the hallway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No, I mean this little hallway in our bureau—comes from the
front entrance. You know, you have been there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. See, there is a little hallway that comes <span class="locked">around——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are talking about the hallway that, as you open the door
off the third floor hallway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No, I am talking about the hallway between the little office and
captain’s office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. For the record, about how far were you from the third floor hallway
when this conversation took place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. 25 feet, approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And do you remember the other officers who were standing
around at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, Leavelle and Montgomery for sure. I don’t know who
else right now. Beck—Dhority and Beck both could have been in there. I am
not sure about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did this conversation with Captain Fritz last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Just long enough to say that—“We are going to get him down
and talk to him, and get the car ready in the basement.” Told Dhority and
Brown what to do about the cars, also Beck, and so, we went up and got him
and brought him down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the time that you were instructed to go up and bring down
Oswald, were Dhority and Brown given instructions by Fritz about the automobiles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I’m going to have to say that I am not sure whether it was at
that moment, or after we brought him down, and I kind of believe that it was
then that they got the cars ready and put them in the basement, and that at
the last minute just before we took him down, we were instructed to move that
car up there to the entrance exit of the jail office, and I am pretty sure that that
is the way that went.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, now, just directing your attention to the time that you
were instructed to go up and bring Oswald down for interrogation, what other
conversation do you remember taking place with Fritz?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, that was all that was said to me at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who went up with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Leavelle and Dhority.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you talk with Lee Oswald on your way down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No, didn’t say anything to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do after you brought Oswald down to the homicide
bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Brought him in the office with Captain Fritz and the other
people that were in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what did you do when <span class="locked">you——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I went back outside and started answering phones, or doing
whatever it was to be done for a while, but I didn’t go back in the office until
just before we were ready to move him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. While you were out there answering telephones and so forth, did
you hear any more about the movement of Oswald to the county jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Not while I was outside, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see Chief Curry come in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he say anything that you heard about the movement of
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Not where I could hear him. He went in the office and this—presumably
discussed something with Captain Fritz. I believe he made a
number of trips there during the time that he was being interviewed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there any rumors circulating in the homicide bureau about
how Oswald would be transferred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Well, then, when was the next time that you got
any information about moving Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Immediately after, just a few minutes before the interview was
completed, I went in the office, and we were instructed that we were to take him
down, and he would be taken in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was in the office when you walked in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, Mr. Sorrels and Mr. Holmes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Sorrels is from the Secret Service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Mr. Holmes is from the Postal Department—I believe it is the
Postal Department, and I can’t think of the other man’s name now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Man from the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes; I have that in the little report that I wrote, but I can’t think
of his name right now. It is a simple name, too, but I can’t think of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it Hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, that is all right. We can get that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. It wasn’t him. Oh, let’s <span class="locked">see——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Any other police officers in the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Let’s see. Leavelle. I believe Montgomery was in there, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what was said when you came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, I walked in and asked—last thing I heard was—Oswald
say was that—“Well, people will soon forget that the President was shot.” And
then—Chief Curry, incidentally, was in there at that time, too, and he was
around over behind the desk by Captain Fritz. Between he and Mr. Sorrels,
and something was discussed about an armored car, but they decided that they
would send an armored car on as a decoy, because it couldn’t get down into the
basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You had heard a conversation about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I heard that discussed just briefly, the armored car was there,
<span class="locked">but——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, did you hear the discussion about a decoy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, Captain Fritz turned back to me and Leavelle, told us that
the armored car would go ahead, and that we would leave out in the regular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
car; so, he told Leavelle to handcuff himself to Oswald. Can I tell you something
off the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I expect it doesn’t matter. I thought about it later. It doesn’t
mean anything, I don’t suppose, unless it has some sentimental value to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear Oswald say anything, or any other conversation
with Oswald before you took him down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I heard some other conversation, but I am vague on what it was.
Discussion between he and—I wish I could remember that man’s name. I want
to say, “O’Malley.” Seems like it was an Irish name. He was asking him something
about his stay in Russia and some of his activities down in Mexico and—but
just what his answer was, I am vague on it. He discussed something with
him, and I wasn’t paying too much attention at the time. Some answers that
he gave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Tell us what happened when Oswald went to get something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. We asked him if he would like to put on something. He just
had on this white T-shirt, see, and asked him if he would like to put on something.
So, when we got these clothes off the rack and started to give him a
light-colored jacket or shirt, and said, “If it is all the same to you”—said, “I’d
rather wear that black sweater.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Whose black sweater was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, his, presumably. So, we let him put it on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where were the clothes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. They were in the captain’s office back there in the back, and
brought them in there so he could pick out something to wear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were they all his?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes, yes; they were. <span class="locked">Then——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you help him put <span class="locked">his——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I assisted him in putting this on. Then, we, of course, started
on out with him. Went on to the elevator, down the hall to what they call
the jail office elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you given any instructions as to how you should guard
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. As I said, I was—told to hold to the arm and walk close to him
and Montgomery was to walk behind us and Captain Fritz, and Lieutenant
Swain in front of us and that is the way we started out to the elevator, and
out of the elevator door over to the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there any discussion about staying close to Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. We were instructed to stay close to him; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, now, was there any discussion about protecting Oswald
from other people who’d like to get at him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, to come down and tell us to do that would be elementary,
actually, because, I mean, we just know to do that, and our captain knows
that we know to do that. So, actually, we weren’t specifically told, “Now, you
just watch this man and don’t let anybody touch him.” Or anything like that.
We were told that the way would be open and nobody would be interfering
with us. Wouldn’t be anybody there. All we would have to do was walk to
the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there any fear that somebody might come right up in
front of him and do something to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. We didn’t have any fear of that because as I said, that—we
were told that the security was so that no one would be there but newsmen
and officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, prior to taking Oswald down to the basement, had you
learned anything about the threatening telephone calls which the police department
had received?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I had not. At that time I didn’t know that there had been any
threatening calls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you subsequently learn?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes; learned later that the FBI had a call to that effect, but
I learned that our office had had similar calls, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What route did you follow when you left Captain Fritz’ office
with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Of course, went out our door and turned left, which would be—south.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Went into the third floor hallway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Third floor hallway; yes, sir; and went to a solid door which
leads us into the jail elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As you walked out, were there news people out in the hallway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes, lots of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there TV cameras up in the hallway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes; all kinds of cameras.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, how long a period of time lapsed from the time you
stopped answering the telephone calls until you got out on the third floor
hallway with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Ten or 15 minutes, I guess, approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you stopped answering the telephone calls to go
into Captain Fritz’ office, were you aware that you were going in there for
the purpose of getting ready to move Oswald out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you become aware of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. We were told that we were going to move him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Captain Fritz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes; I don’t know whether he walked out and told me. You know,
in the process, the door was opened and he talked to some of us at the door
and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, prior to the time that you actually went out there in
the hallway with Oswald, did you have any information as to whether the
people who were members of the press were aware that Oswald was about
to be brought out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I—it was my understanding they knew that he was to be
transferred at 10 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, I <span class="locked">mean——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, no, no; we—if you mean if we—told them when we were
leaving with him, we didn’t do that. We just walked out with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But what about a sharp newsman who was keeping his eyes
and ears open? Could he see through the door? Could he see the activity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Could he see the <span class="locked">preparation——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. For bringing <span class="locked">out——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could one see Oswald putting on his sweater, for example?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Maybe not that, but he could have seen us pass it over to him.
I believe those blinds were open there on—coming out to the secretary’s office
there. I believe they were. I’m not sure about that, but if they were open
they could have seen from the front door standing at the hallway at an angle.
They could have seen that sweater or clothes changing hands. I don’t believe
where Oswald was standing he could see him from that angle, but I—like I
said, a good, sharp newsman knowing the activity, he could see and naturally
know that something was fixing to happen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you arrived at the elevators on the third floor, was the
elevator there waiting for you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I think it was waiting right there for us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, which elevator did you come down in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. It is called the inside jail elevator, which is used only for the
transfer of prisoners from one floor to the other and basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And who went into the elevator with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, it was Leavelle, Montgomery, Swain, and Captain Fritz
and myself and, of course, Oswald.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was Chief Curry at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I don’t know. He left just before we did and I don’t know
where he went.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long would you estimate Chief Curry left before you people
walked out of the homicide bureau with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. You know, I couldn’t tell you. I—I—actually, the chief could
have been standing in there somewhere and I wouldn’t know it—because when
we were given the final go to get him ready or get his sweater on him, I didn’t
pay any attention to who else was in there or what happened. They told me
to get him ready and walked out with him. He could have left a few minutes
ahead of us; I don’t know, it would be a guess, because I really don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, what happened when you got to the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, we got down to the basement. We hesitated on the elevator
until Captain Fritz and Lieutenant Swain stepped out. Then we followed
them around the outside exit door into the hallway which leads to the ramp
and then hesitated there a little bit with Oswald so they could check out there
and see that everything was all right, and when we got the go ahead sign
that everything was all right we walked out with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how many steps did you take before something happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. You mean after we walked out in the hallway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. It is approximately 15 feet from where I was to the jail house
door where we came out into the hallway, roughly 15 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see Jack Ruby move out of the crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No; I didn’t see Jack Ruby move out of the crowd.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was the first time that you noticed Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I estimated before I saw the film it was a split second before
he pulled that trigger and actually, he was taking a step and coming down
like so [indicating]. I caught him out of the corner of my eye and I thought
that I started reaching for him at that moment, which the film indicates that
I did, which happened quickly, as you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Just a matter of simultaneous movement. You just move when
you see something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you actually see the gun before you heard it—heard the
shots fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes; in fact, that is the first thing I saw coming that way, and
I just started after it, I guess, automatically, nothing else to do, that I could see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see how the newsmen were spread out as you walked out
of that hallway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I saw how they weren’t spread out. I was under the impression
there wouldn’t be any news media inside that rampway, that they would be
behind that area over there, but they were in the way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you get that impression?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, Chief Curry told Captain Fritz that the security was taken
care of, that there wouldn’t be nobody in that ramp. Anyway, that cameras
would be over behind that rail of that ramp. So, what we expected to find was
our officers along the side there, but we found newsmen inside that ramp, in
fact, in the way of that car. Now, we—Captain Fritz sent Dhority and Brown
and Beck on down to the basement in plenty of time to get that car up there for
us, and when they got down there and run into mass confusion of pressmen, we
almost backed over some of them to get up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, after Fritz sent Dhority and Brown down, did they send
word back up to Fritz’ office that everything was ready in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Somebody did. I believe Baker called—Lieutenant Baker called
down from our office to check with the jail downstairs and see that everything
was ready. Somebody gave them the word. I don’t know whether it was
Lieutenant Wiggins or who told them that it was all right. Everything was
in order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You say you were quite surprised when you saw these news
people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I was surprised that they were rubbing my elbow. You know,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
if you saw that film, you saw one of them with a mike in his hand. He actually
rubbed my elbow. We were in a slight turn when this thing happened, and my
attention had been called to that car door, and this joker was standing there
with a microphone in his hand, and others that—I don’t know if they were newsmen—they
weren’t officers—had cameras around their necks and everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As you looked up at that line of news people, from your left over
to the TV cameras, how many lines deep is it your recollection that they were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, I would say two or three deep until they crossed that ramp
and went down the side. Might not have been more than one deep there. Might
not have been much room, because the car was trying to come in there. Might
have been two deep. I know there was a line of men there, and how deep I
don’t know. I saw through the corner of my eye a movement over there of men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As you walked out, did you notice any police officers that you
recognized?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Oh, yes; I recognized officers standing around the walls there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As you walked out, did you see Officer Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No; I didn’t see him. Matter of fact, I never did see him until
it was all over. You are talking about “Blackie”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. “Blackie” Harrison; W. J. Harrison.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I didn’t see him until it was all over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you saw Jack come forward with the gun in his hand, did
you hear anybody say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I heard noise. There was a racing of a motor and noises, talking
going on. As I say, my attention had been directed to that car, and we had
already turned, looked in that direction and something could have been said,
but as I said, I heard noises but just exactly what was said I wasn’t able to
determine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What do you remember doing when Jack came forward with
the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I remember going after the gun. Just the moment I saw him,
that is what I actually did, was go for the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you wrestle with him? With Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Will you tell us what you remember Jack Ruby doing from the
time you saw him and while you wrestled with him and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, I grabbed his arm by the wrist with my left hand, and
grabbed right over the gun with my right hand simultaneously.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You grabbed the arm holding the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes; and jerked it down and across my leg and turned my back
to him, and, of course, he was trying to pull back, and was squeezing on that
trigger like so [indicating].</p>

<p>I had his wrist here [indicating], and I could feel it, and I remember saying,
“turn it loose. Turn it loose.” You know, like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you are making a motion like you are twisting his arm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes; I was. See, I had it like this, and I had got that arm and
then twisted that gun like that [indicating], right out of his hand, see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me indicate for the record that you have shown that you
twisted his arm 180°.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Until he released it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Until he released the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long was it from the time you released—grabbed his arm
until he released the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Just a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It was not a long struggle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Fairly easy to wrestle the gun away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Put it this way. It wasn’t easy because he had a grip on the
gun, but the way I took it, he had to turn it loose. I had his arm—kind of hard
to explain—take your arm and bend it over my leg like that and twist down on
it like that [indicating]. You have got to give.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are bending the arm over your leg?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did Jack say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. He didn’t say anything to me. I understand that he said
something, that is, some things to the officer that took him in. <span class="locked">I——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I mean, as you were struggling with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No; not to me. I had his arm over and my back to him and,
of course, officers were covering him up, and when I got the gun loose from him,
of course, they snatched him away from me, and by the time I got straightened
up to check that gun and see if the hammer was back or not, they had already
taken him into the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do there? You were standing there or lying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I was standing. I never did go down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Standing with the gun in your hand, what did you do at
that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Put the gun in my pocket and went on inside the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you arrived inside the jail office, where was Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Ruby was, I believe, to my right; just to my right, to the
right of the jail office door. Of course, there were men around there and
Oswald was <span class="locked">back——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I didn’t remain with Ruby at all. Just kind of hesitated and
looked over and went on. I believe Montgomery asked me if I got the gun
and I said, “Yes,” and kept on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you walk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Walked back to where Oswald was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear him say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I didn’t hear him say anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do when you got back to where Oswald was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Stood there and watched the doctor work with him until the
ambulance came.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, they put him in the ambulance and I got in the ambulance
with him and went to Parkland Hospital and got off there and took him right
into emergency and worked with him a few minutes. And got him prepared
for the operating room, and, so, we caught the elevator with him and with
the doctors and nurses and went on up to the second floor, and I changed
into one of those scrub uniforms and crepe-soled shoes and went over to the
door of the operating room, where I stayed until such time as he was pronounced
dead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Outside of the operating room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As you were standing outside of the operating room, did you
hear discussion about how Ruby got into the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No; I didn’t—an FBI man came up there a little later and stood
with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. To go back just a minute, you have already told me this before
in an earlier interview, but I want to make this clear for the record. You
knew Ruby before this occasion when you saw him shoot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I will tell you how I knew Ruby. He opened a joint, a dancehall
down on South Ervay called the Silver Spur something like 10 years ago, approximately.
That is where I first knew Jack Ruby existed. Since that time I
have just known about Jack <span class="locked">Ruby——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you know him down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, as a joint operator, you know, when you work in a
uniform that is part of the business, to know who runs places.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What bureau were you in at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I was in the radio patrol bureau at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. And later I learned that he opened a place out on Oak Lawn
called The Vegas Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see Ruby in the police department over the years
before that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I have never in my entire time at that police station seen Jack
Ruby in the police station. Now, it is possible Jack was down there. I know he
has been in jail, but to say that he, like some people do hang around the
police station, I have never seen him do that, and I have worked all hours.
That still doesn’t mean that he couldn’t have been coming in there. However,
with someone that worked opposite hours to me—and I wouldn’t see him, but
during the time that I have been there I have never seen him hanging around
the police station. You know, speculation is, is that he is a friend of the
police and so forth. He might have done some policeman some favor, I don’t
know that to be true, so, it would be speculating on my part to say that he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain at Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Oh, I’d hate to say this for the record, not seeing my report.
Until he died. This in the basement happened about 11:10, or 11:19, and we
reached Parkland a few minutes after. He was pronounced dead at 1 something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don’t really care about the exact time. We are going to get
the time records and check it out there but what I am trying to establish is
when you learned that he was dead, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, of course, we made arrangements to get the pathologist up
there and maintaining guards over him, even during the time he was in the
morgue. We discussed that, and then Clardy and Brown were charged with that
responsibility, and I changed clothes and me and Leavelle, I believe me and
Leavelle came back to city hall with Officer Burgess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About what time would you say he got back to the city hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, again, I wouldn’t want to say definitely. I think somewhere
around 2:30 or 3:45, somewhere in that vicinity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Up to the time that you got back to city hall, had you heard
anything about how Ruby might have gotten into the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No; I hadn’t, sure hadn’t. Of course, everyone was wondering
at that point how it happened and how he got in there, but I hadn’t heard anything
at that point. Hadn’t seen or been around anybody except those that I
went out there with and they didn’t know any more than I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you got back to the police department, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I went back to the office, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Homicide bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Homicide bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was there at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, frankly, I don’t remember who all were in the office. I
know Jack Ruby was in Captain Fritz’ office talking with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who else was in Captain Fritz’ office at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I don’t know, frankly. That window blind was open there and
I could see Jack Ruby, and I could see Captain Fritz and some other people
were in there, but just who, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, was Jack Ruby fully clothed at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I believe they had already put some white clothes on him, jail
clothes, taken his suit off of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you go into Captain Fritz’ office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No; I didn’t. I didn’t see Jack Ruby anymore until they
transferred him to the county.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk to any police officer that day about how Ruby got
into the jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. As I say, I just heard rumors going around, and at this point
I don’t really remember who related it to me, but—there was rumors that
<span class="locked">he——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember as you got back there what the first rumor
was that you heard circulating?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes; that he slipped in the basement by a squad car when they
drove out the north ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You heard this when you got back to <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Sometime after I got back. Just exactly when, I don’t know, but
that got around shortly after. It could have been 2 or 3 hours later, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was the next rumor that you heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, I don’t know. I heard that Chief Batchelor and a couple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
of the detectives had walked down the ramp and Ruby walked in with them, and
I heard that he probably had a pass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. <span class="locked">And——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Press pass, and he used that on one of the officers at the door
to get in. You can hear everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you first hear the rumor that he had walked down
the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, I can’t remember. Just some time that day after we got
back there from the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear it before or after the other rumors that you are
relating?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. That was the first one that I heard, really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That he walked down the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. That he walked down the ramp when that squad car drove out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And people came out of Captain Fritz’ office, who had been
talking with Ruby, did you hear anything coming out of Captain Fritz’ office
as to how Ruby got in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No; sure didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever learn from any of the detectives who had been
talking to Ruby in Captain Fritz’ office how Ruby got into the jail basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, let’s see. I don’t know who it was, that told me how he
(Ruby) got in. Now, Captain Fritz later told us that he asked Ruby how he
got in there and he told him, I believe it was, at that time that he would rather
not discuss that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. And did Captain Fritz tell you this shortly after
this interview that Fritz was having with Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. It was some time after the interview. And I don’t remember
exactly when, but it was some time after he had talked with him. Maybe the
second time, I don’t know, but it was some time after he had told him, and they
<span class="locked">told——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, at the time that Ruby—at the time that you learned from
Fritz that Ruby didn’t want to talk about how he got in this basement, had
you already heard that Ruby came down the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you already heard the other rumors which you have
related?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you later hear from Captain Fritz, or any other police
officer that he had talked with Ruby and Ruby had said something about how
he got <span class="locked">in——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I didn’t hear that from Captain Fritz that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But, from any other police officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Something to the effect that he told somebody how he got in
there, but I never did find out the straight of that. They had started a full
scale investigation in terms of what happened in the basement at that time.
Nobody was telling anybody anything so I just dropped it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About what time did <span class="locked">they——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I don’t know exactly when they started that, but, they started
trying to find out what happened, and I am sure, immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever talk with Officer Dean, as far as you can remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I didn’t discuss it with Officer Dean at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever talk with Officer McMillon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or Officer Clardy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Can we go off the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On the record for this. Is there anything that we haven’t covered
in connection with the murder of Lee Oswald, including how Ruby got
into the basement, or things that might shed some light upon Ruby’s motive
or possible associates that he might have had that you could tell the Commission?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No, and I wish that there was. Listen, as I said, we have heard
a lot of things but we have never been able to prove anything, so, again, what
I have heard is just speculation, and just talk. I have heard that he was connected
with any number of people. Trying to prove that—telling us—but
there is nothing concrete in terms of evidence to prove that he was connected
with them in any way, so far as I know. Somebody may know something that
I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know anything of your own knowledge that you think
might bear light one way or the other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No, I don’t; again, like I say, I wish that there was something,
but, of course, I am sure that everybody is like me and listen to everybody
and everything and try to make sense out of this thing to the best of their
ability by checking everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I’m going to mark for identification here—we are going to call
this, “Dallas, Tex., Detective Graves, March 24, 1904. Exhibit No. 5003.” And
I’m going to mark these pages 5003-A and 5003-B and 5003-C. Now, these are
copies of FBI reports which purport to be interviews that were had by the
FBI agents, with you. Exhibit 5003-A is a report of an interview on November
24, taken by Special Agent Bookhout and Agent Rabidoux. Do you remember
approximately when these gentlemen talked with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. To the best of my recollection, it was in the evening part of the
day, but just exactly when, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, Exhibit 5003-B, and Exhibit 5003-C, consists of one
interview with you by Special Agent Bookhout, Jim Bookhout.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And that was dated on November 24. Do you remember approximately
what time of day that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. That was pretty soon after this thing happened, after I got
back from the hospital, so, you can say roughly, I guess, around 3 o’clock,
3 or 4 o’clock. That is just—that is an approximate time. He was the first
one I talked to. There was something in there that I want to call your attention
to, though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me hand these to you and let you examine Exhibits 5003-A,
5003-B and C, and tell us if there is anything in there that you would want
to amplify or correct or change in any manner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Let me see. I will have to find it now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Just take your time.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. This right here says, “Captain Fritz was in the lead and was
standing at the edge of the ramp waiting to get into the front seat of the
car,” actually, he was at the rear of that car door, fixing to open it, if he
didn’t already have it open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What exhibit number are you referring to, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. 5003-B. No; that’s right here. “Graves and Leavelle stopped
momentarily for the car to back up,” that is a bad choice of phrasing in that
situation. We, actually can’t say that we were stopped, we were still in
motion when this thing happened. It was a momentary glance to the right and
a slight turn in that direction, but we were still in motion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you make this correction as a result of having viewed the
movies, or something that you remember independently of the movies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I remembered that later. Of course, I saw it also on the movies
later which verified it, but after I had gotten this thing and read it over then,
I realized that we actually hadn’t stopped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I recall that I have neglected to administer an oath to you
in the course of this deposition, Mr. Graves. I wonder if you would raise your
right hand. Do you solemnly swear that everything that you have said here
today is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there anything more that you have to tell us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I can’t think of anything at this time. Except for those little
things, I believe those are basically true and correct.</p>

<h2 id="GRAVES_RESUMED">TESTIMONY OF L. C. GRAVES RESUMED</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of L. C. Graves was taken at 10:55 a.m., on April 17, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the
President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is a continuation of the deposition of Mr. L. C. Graves of
the Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. Graves, as you know, my name is Leon Hubert, and I am one of the
staff members of the Commission.</p>

<p>Previously, to wit, on March 24, 1964, you gave a deposition through which
Mr. Burt Griffin appeared as a staff member. He cited to you at that time the
authority under which he was acting, and also I think you took an oath at
that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you willing to consider this morning’s continuation as a
part of that deposition given on March 24, 1964, in the sense that I am acting
under the same authority and have the same authority as Mr. Griffin had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you willing to consider also that you are under the same
oath that you took at the earlier time for this later time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that this is just a continuation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As though it were the next day instead of 3 weeks later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The purpose of asking you to come back is to clarify something
which appears on pages 67 and 68 of your deposition on March 24, 1964. At
line 17 on page 67, you asked Mr. Griffin as follows:</p>

<p>“Can I tell you something off the record?” And he answered in line 18,
“Sure.” Then, the record at line 19 indicates that there was a discussion off
the record. Now, you give an answer between lines 21 and 24 as follows, to wit:</p>

<p>“I expect it doesn’t matter. I thought about it later. It doesn’t mean anything,
I don’t suppose, unless it has some sentimental value to him.” Now, the
next sentence and the next few lines which go over to page 68, do not seem to
refer to the matter which in that quoted sentence you designated as “having
some sentimental value.” Now, I invite your attention to lines 15 through 22
on page 68 and ask you to read those lines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Starting with Mr. Griffin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; starting with your answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. “We asked him——”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; don’t read them out loud, just read them to yourself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. [Read deposition as requested by Counsel Hubert.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I ask you if the thought contained in your testimony at
page 68 between lines 15 and 22 does not relate to the matter which you had characterized
as something having a sentimental value to him on lines 22 thru 24
on page 67?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. That’s what I had reference to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would it be fair to say, then, that there was no more to the
conversation off the record than the subject of something that had a sentimental
value, and that the thing that did have sentimental value was explained by you
in your answer on page 68 between lines 15 and 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Not only would it be fair, but it would be truthful, because that’s
exactly what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s exactly what happened and nothing more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. And nothing more or nothing less.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. That’s all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; that’s all. I hate to bring you down for something like
this, but we had to do it to get it clear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. That’s all right—that’s all right.</p>

<h2 id="LEAVELLE">TESTIMONY OF JAMES ROBERT LEAVELLE</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of James Robert Leavelle was taken at 3:30 p.m., on March 25,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the
President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of James R. Leavelle, with the Dallas
Police Department. Mr. Leavelle, my name is Leon Hubert. I am a member
of the advisory staff of the General Counsel on the President’s Commission.
Under the provisions of the Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963,
and Joint Resolution of Congress No. 137 and the rules of procedure adopted
by the Commission in accordance with the Executive order and the joint resolution,
I have been authorized to take a sworn deposition from you, Mr. Leavelle.
I state to you now that the general nature of the Commission’s inquiry is to
ascertain, evaluate and report upon the facts relevant to the assassination of
President Kennedy and subsequent violent death of Lee H. Oswald. In particular
to you, Mr. Leavelle, the nature of the inquiry today is to determine
what facts you know about the death of Oswald and any other pertinent facts
you may know about the general inquiry.</p>

<p>Mr. Leavelle, you have appeared today by virtue of a general request made
to Chief Curry by Mr. J. Lee Rankin, the general counsel of the staff
of the President’s Commission, and also, under the rules of the Commission,
you are entitled to a 3-day written notice prior to the taking of the deposition,
but the rules also provide that a witness may waive this 3-day notice, if he
wishes to do so. Now, you have not had that 3-day notice, and so, I wish to
know if you would like to waive the 3-day notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, then, would you—I think you said you would waive
that notice, didn’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you stand and raise your right hand so that I can swear
you in?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that you will tell the truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you please state your full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. James Robert Leavelle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. <span class="locked">Forty——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your residence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Wait. Forty-three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your residence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. 7703 Rilla Avenue, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Police officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been so occupied?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Fourteen years, approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you held the position you now hold?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. About 8 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is that position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. A detective.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any particular part of the department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I work at the present time in the homicide and robbery bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is your immediate superior there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Capt. Will Fritz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And who is above him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Chief Stevenson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who answers, in turn, to Chief Curry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now I pass to you two documents which you have read, and
which I now want to identify, by marking them as follows: The first document,
which purports to be a report by FBI Agent Bookhout, of an interview
with you on November 24, I am marking as follows: “Dallas, Tex., March 25,
1964, Exhibit No. 5088. Deposition of J. R. Leavelle.” I am signing my name
below that, and marking the second page with my initials, in the lower right-hand
corner. The second document I am also marking, “Dallas, Tex., March 25,
1964. Exhibit 5089, deposition of J. R. Leavelle,” and signing my name also
and placing my initials in the lower right-hand corner of the second page of
that document. The second document, 5089, purports to be an FBI report of
an interview with you by Special Agents Bramblett and Logan. Now, addressing
myself first to the document which is marked 5088, I will ask you if you
have read that document?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And whether or not it states substantially the truth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Substantially so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, did you find any errors in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No; I think that is all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you wish to delete or add anything to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No; let it stand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With that, would you, please, sign your name below mine, if
you wish, and initial the second page below my initials. Now, I hand you the
document that I have marked for identification as Exhibit 5089, and ask you
the same questions with respect to that document.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes; I think this is the one that had the article in there about
the short interview, if it makes any difference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, would you point out what paragraph you are talking
about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Let me see if I can find it here. I am sure it was on this one
rather than the other one. There was one right here on the—on the one
Bookhout took. Now, let me see that again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. It is the contents of the last paragraph on the second page,
Mr. Hubert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you are speaking of the third sentence of the last paragraph
on the second page, a sentence which reads as follows, to wit: “He was
never present while Oswald was being interviewed, nor was he present while
Ruby was being interviewed by the Dallas Police officers.” I think you wish
to comment upon that, do you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Correct that to read, “With the exception of possibly 15 minutes
prior to the actual transfer began on the 24th.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, after you had been selected as an officer to
<span class="locked">whom——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Would handle the transfer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were directed to go to Captain Fritz’ office, and you did so,
is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Of course, I was directed to go there early in the morning. I
have that. What I am referring to, of course, once I got Oswald out of jail I
stayed with him up to the end.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you get him out of jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I got him out of jail at, oh, I don’t remember the exact time,
but it was—it was between 9:30 that morning that I was instructed to go get
him by Captain Fritz from the jail, and bring him to his office, which I did,
and I went into his cell and put the handcuffs on him inside the cell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you brought him down <span class="locked">to——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Brought him down, and I remained with him, or in the office
from then on up until the actual transfer took place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, during that period, was there interviewing going on only
15 minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Well, I made a note here, “at 9:30,” but I could be in error
on that time. They may have talked—I am sure that my note is in error<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
here. It would probably be between 10:30 and 11, probably an hour off of that.
However, there is a transfer sign out which would show the correct time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is what you call a—“tempo”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. The “tempo,” yes, which shows the correct time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Anyway, you were with Oswald at all times from the time of
the “tempo,” until he was actually shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And any interviewing that happened in that period you were
present at?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that you want to modify Exhibit 5089, in the sentence that I
read in that respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Jack Ruby, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes, I had known him. I have—I had previously stated I met
him back in 1951, or thereabouts, when I was working the area that his Silver
Spur was located in on South Ervay, and became acquainted with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand that some time in 1963, you received an anonymous
call that there was going to be a hijacking of his club. What does that mean,
a “hijacking”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. That means that someone is going to use a pistol and take the
money from the cashier, or whoever had custody of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, a robbery, or burglary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Armed robbery is what it amounts to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, in order to guard against that, you and a fellow officer went
down <span class="locked">to——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Down to the club and stayed there watching for it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. We stayed there until closing time. I think they stopped the
people from coming in, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not tell Ruby what was going on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes; we told—of course, Ruby was not there. This was
the Carousel Club on Oak Lawn, which was operated by his sister, Eva Grant,
and we told her what the situation was, and she gave us a—use of a booth
near the door where we could get there in the booth and observe anyone coming
in or out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was the Vegas Club on Ervay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No, sir; on Oak Lawn. That is the Carousel on Commerce
Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The Silver Spur?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. The Silver Spur, it has long since been out of existence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you told his sister what the situation was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And Ruby came in later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. He came in just about closing time, and she probably had
called him, because he already knew that we were out here. Of course, I just
am assuming she had probably already called him. He didn’t seem particular
perturbed about it at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you recognize Ruby right away when he came out of the
crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I recognized him as someone that I knew, but I was unable
to call his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just describe in your own words how the whole thing happened,
what you saw from the time you left the jail door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. From the time we left the jail door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; push it back a little further. From the time you left
the jail cell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. All right, when we left the jail cell, we proceeded down to
the booking desk there, up to the door leading out into the basement, and I
purposely told Mr. Graves to hold it a minute while Captain Fritz checked the
area outside. I don’t know why I did that, because we had not made any
plans to do so, but I said, “Let’s hold it a minute and let him see if everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
is in order.” Because we had been given to understand that the car would
be across the passageway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of the jail corridor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. And that—and we would have nothing to do but walk straight
from the door, approximately 13 or 14 feet to the car and then Captain Fritz—when
we asked him to give us the high sign on it he said, “Everything is all
set.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you notice what time it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No; I did not. That is the only error that I can see. The
captain should have known that the car was not in the position it should be,
and I was surprised when I walked to the door and the car was not in the
spot it should have been, but I could see it was in back, and backing into position,
but had it been in position where we were told it would be, that would
have eliminated a lot of the area in which anyone would have access to him,
because it would have been blocked by the car. In fact, if the car had been
sitting where we were told it was going to be, see—it would have been sitting
directly upon the spot where Ruby was standing when he fired the shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, in that case the television cameras would have been
blocked out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. That’s true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The car was not pulled back because pulling it back would
block <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. That, I don’t know. Of course, you are—according to one
of my previous reports I earlier suggested to Captain Fritz that we make the
suggestion to the chief that we take him out to the first floor and put him out
at Main Street to a car and proceed to the county jail that way and leave them
waiting in the basement and on Commerce Street, and we could be to the county
jail before anyone knew what was taking place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you make that suggestion, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. That was either just before or just after—probably just after
I had gone there and got Oswald and we were talking about the transfer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who did you make that suggestion to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I made it to Captain Fritz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What answer did you receive from him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Said he didn’t think the chief would go for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Because, he said, the chief had given his word to the press
that they would transfer him at a time when they could make pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you convey that same idea to the chief, himself, or to anyone
other than Fritz?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Other than to Mr. Beck and Brown, Mr. Clardy that was
there—Mr. Graves rather. They probably heard me make the suggestion. In
fact, Mr. Beck made the suggestion at the same time that we could—I know
that he was there, because he made the suggestion at the time, same time, said
well, that we could either—instead of going out the Commerce Street, in front
of all the people lined up, go out the basement in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean even if you are going to use the basement, use the
Main Street instead of Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. That’s right; and he made that suggestion. Of course, Chief
Curry had already given his word to the newsmen that they would transfer
him and let them get the pictures, and I have just assumed since that the reason
that the car wasn’t in position like it was supposed to be was so that they could
get the pictures, and the reason for not holding to the schedule previously
outlined.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you spoken to the chief about that since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you spoken to anybody about it, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No; I haven’t spoke to anyone other than possibly just some
of the officers making a remark, “If he had used my suggestion, that we would
probably have made it.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You said that you had reported making that suggestion in one
of the reports that you made?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes; I think it is in this one right here, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have a copy of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes—that is another one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, you have made reference to another report which
appears on page 63, Commission’s Document No. 81-A, entitled “Investigation
of the operational security involving the transfer of Lee Harvey Oswald, November
24, 1963,” prepared by the Dallas Police Department. I am not going
to take that page 63, which is in two parts of the bound Commission Document
81-A, but I am going to identify it by marking on it, to-wit, as follows: “Dallas,
Texas, March 25, 1964. Exhibit 5090, deposition of J. R. Leavelle,” signing
my name below that endorsement, and placing my initial on the second page
in the lower right-hand corner. Who prepared this document, 5090?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I prepared it. It was typed by our secretary up here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it signed by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No; it was not—well, wait a minute now. I believe there
was one copy which was, but probably the original that—now, this looks like
a <span class="locked">mimeographed——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mimeographed or photographed—one of those. Have you read
it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes, sir; I have read it. In fact, here is a copy of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have a copy in your possession right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I notice the fourth paragraph on the first page, when you
state that you had suggested the transfer be via the first floor of the Main
Street door, and that is a recordation of that thought made—when was this
dictated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. When was this dictated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. It was, what you might say, some 2 or 3 days after that, after
the shooting. I don’t recall the exact date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, would <span class="locked">you——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. In from 2 or 3 days afterward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you complete the identification of this document by
placing your signature directly below mine on the first page and your initials
below mine on the second page? Did you state that fact to the FBI, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I don’t recall whether I did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t believe it is in either of the other two documents of
the FBI that I have here, 5088, or 5089. Is there any reason why you didn’t?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Well, to the best of my knowledge it seems as though I might
have made that suggestion, made the reference to that, but whether whoever
was taking it said that they didn’t need it in their report. I’m sure that’s—now,
of course, I can’t swear to this, but I think that is correct because I know
I—I am not able to recall at this time exactly what the conversation was
between myself and the agent—I—in this, in its entirety, I do know there
was one or two things that I told them about, which they did say that they
didn’t think was necessary for their report, so, they did not put it in there.
Now, whether that was one of them or not, I do not recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On the occasion that you think that you might have stated
that to the FBI agent, was there one agent interviewing you, or two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I believe at one time the two were interviewing me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many interviews have you had with the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Twice. Mr. Bookhout was out, and then Mr. Bookhout interviewed
me on the morning after the shooting, I believe. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Dated November 24.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Twenty-fourth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That would be the day of the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes, that is what I mean, and then the other one was sometime
after or with the two agents?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you think it was during the interrogation by the two agents
on December 10, 1963, that you mentioned about your suggestion that the
route should be through the first floor of the Main Street entrance of the municipal
building coming out the Main Street door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, that those agents told you that that was not important?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. They didn’t need it for that particular form.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. To the best of my knowledge, of course, my reason for double-crossing—my
reasons for wanting to handle it the other way, I thought it
would be done quicker and easier and I was fed up to my chin, in a way, with
these news people, and they—as soon as we could get rid of them the better,
was my sentiments, and I didn’t have any desire to parade through them with
the prisoner in tow. However, I can understand why the chief wanted to let
them take the pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had it been your decision you wouldn’t have done it that way,
is that it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Either as I suggested, or at a different hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Say move him in the morning early?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes, I brought Ruby down in safety and I don’t think there
was any—as long as it was successful, I don’t think you can argue with
success.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you transfer Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was done at an unannounced hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Well, sir; it was so unannounced that the chief didn’t know
about it and neither did Sheriff Decker. I don’t know whether they will admit
that or not, but no one knew it but Captain Fritz and myself and three or four
officers directly involved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You all just decided to do it, and that was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Well, the captain called me and asked me about it and told
me what he was thinking about doing and he wanted to know if I thought
it would work and I said, “Yes, I think it will the way it has been set up,” and he
said, “I haven’t asked the chief about it,” and I said, “All you can do is get
a bawling out, but a bawling out is better than losing a prisoner.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you get bawled out about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I didn’t. I did not know whether he did or not. I doubt
it. Because I am sure the chief was relieved to be rid of the responsibility.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How was Ruby removed, then, just for the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Well, this would be on Monday morning, I guess, the next
Monday morning around 11, around the same hour that Oswald was transferred.
The captain had not showed up and I—he called on the telephone and asked for
me and his secretary called me to the phone, and I was in the squad room where
several officers were, and asked me if I was in a position where I could talk,
and I said, “No, not really,” and he said, “Well—” told me to go into his office
and take the phone in there, which I did, and he said, “I am down at the Greyhound
Bus Station, and I have Officers Graves and Montgomery with me.”</p>

<p>He had run into them on the street. Said, “We have cased the jail and it
looks clear. I am going to make a suggestion to you, and if you don’t think it
will work I want you to tell me.”</p>

<p>Said—he said, “We’ll pull through the basement of the city hall,” said, “You
go get Ruby out of the jail anyway you want to, on a “tempo” or whatever
you think best, and bring him down to me, down in the elevator and we’ll pull
through the basement at some given time, and we’ll load him up and whisk
him right on down and let another squad follow us and we will take him right
on down to the county jail.”</p>

<p>Said, “The sheriff—I haven’t called Decker or the chief about it, either.”
Said, “Do you think it will work?”</p>

<p>I said, “Yes.” Said, “How many men—got enough there to help you with
him?”</p>

<p>I said, “Yes, there is three or four here I can get.”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell anybody where you are going. Just get them like you are going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
after coffee and get downstairs or somewhere and tell them what you are going
to do.”</p>

<p>So, I went into the squad room (Captain Fritz had called) Lieutenant Wells,
and told him not to let the officers out of the office because he wanted us when
he got in there so I just walked out and motioned to Mr. Brown and Dhority and
Mr. Beck and told them to follow me, and didn’t say a word to anyone, and walked
downstairs, and, of course, they are curious, and when I got downstairs I outlined
the deal to them and told Beck and Brown to get the car—get the other
car in the basement and have it in position to go out, and Dhority and I went
up and got the prisoner and brought him down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Brought him down the jail elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Down the jail elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were any newsmen down in the station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Beg your pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there any newsmen down in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. In fact, when I walked out one of the newspapermen asked
me when we were going to transfer Ruby and I said, “Oh, I don’t know.” And
just like that, and walked on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had Ruby with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. You mean—oh, no; the officers and I walking down. When
we brought Ruby down in the jail elevator, that elevator is never in view of
the public. It is an inside elevator. Never in view of the public, so, anyway,
after talking to the captain, I set my watch with his and said, “Be there at
exactly 11:15.”</p>

<p>So, he set his watch with mine and we brought Ruby down. That is the
reason—I got down there about a minute and a half, 2 minutes early to the
basement and told the lieutenant on duty, told everybody not to ring for the
elevator that we would have it tied up, just held him in the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Kept Ruby in the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Kept Ruby in the elevator. Mr. Brown standing outside of the
jail office, Mr. Beck had his car, his motor running in the parking basement,
and Mr. Brown was standing there talking to one of the men in the jail office
just as though he was passing the time of day, and he was to give me the nod
as soon as the captain’s car pulled in on the ramp, which he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which side did he pull in on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Just came off the Main Street ramp and parked across the
opening and when he saw him pull in, gave me the high sign and we took
Ruby and told him, I said, “I don’t want to have to push you or shove you. I
want you to move.” Of course, Ruby was scared, so, he almost outran me to the
car. He ran and got in the back seat of the car with Graves, who was already
in the back seat, and Montgomery was driving and Mr. Beck, Dhority, and
Brown got to the other car and followed us. We proceeded directly to the
county jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Up Commerce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. We went up Commerce to the expressway and cut back on
the expressway to Main Street, and came down Main Street to Houston Street
where the jail is located, and around the corner on Houston Street, to the
entrance of the county jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any trouble with the traffic going down Main
Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. We caught every light green going down. Didn’t have to
stop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have the sirens going?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No, we did not. We drove through there at a good little step
faster than normal, but so happened we caught every light. I don’t think
we even missed a light. When we reached the jail, the officers in the car behind
us bailed out and covered the entrance to the jail, and we were—had him
inside in a matter of 20 seconds, from the time the car stopped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir. Is there anything else you want to add about
anything we have talked about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I can’t think of anything else that would be pertinent to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Thank you. One more thing on this. You have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
not been previously interviewed by me, or any other members of the Commission’s
staff, have you, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Okay. That’s all.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="MONTGOMERY">TESTIMONY OF DETECTIVE L. D. MONTGOMERY</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of Detective L. D. Montgomery was taken at 4 p.m., on
March 24, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,
Bryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Burt W. Griffin, assistant counsel
of the President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Before I administer the oath to you, I want to state for the
record, and for your information, what this whole proceeding is all about, and
I will introduce myself for the record. My name is Burt W. Griffin, and I’m a
member of the advisory staff of the General Counsel’s Office of the President’s
Commission to investigate the assassination of President Kennedy. Now, the
Commission consists of seven men, Chief Justice Warren, Senator Cooper, Senator
Russell, Congressman Ford of Michigan, and Congressman Hale Boggs of
Louisiana, and Allen Dulles, and John McCloy. That is it. And this Commission
has an investigatory staff, and that is us. Now, the Commission was appointed
under what is known as Executive Order 11130, dated November 29,
1963, and also under a joint resolution of Congress, 137, and we have also
prescribed, pursuant to this order and resolution, a set of rules and procedures
which have been adopted by the Commission, and I have been authorized, pursuant
to all those orders to take your sworn deposition. Now, a letter has
been sent to Chief Curry indicating that I do have this authority to inquire
and ascertain and evaluate and report upon the facts relating to the assassination
of President Kennedy and the subsequent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.
In particular to you, Mr. Montgomery, the nature of the inquiry today is to
determine what facts you know about the death of Oswald, but also to develop
any other pertinent facts that you may know about the general inquiry, but our
central focus in this deposition is going to be on things connected with Ruby’s
killing of Oswald. Now, you have appeared here today on the basis of a request
which was made by the General Counsel of the Commission. Naturally,
under the rules of the Commission you have a right to receive a 3 days’ written
notice prior to the taking of your deposition. We can be required to send you
a letter in writing. Now I will ask you if, at this point, if you would desire
that notice, or if you are willing to waive the notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Waive it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. Also, I should tell you that you are entitled to have an
attorney here if you want, and many of the witnesses have appeared with
attorneys, and if you indicate to me that you would like to have your deposition
postponed until you could talk with an attorney, I will be happy to do that
also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I don’t know any reason why I would need to consult
with one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. Do you want to raise your right hand? Do you solemnly
swear that the testimony you are going to give will be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, will you state for the record your full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Leslie Dell [spelling] D-e-l-l Montgomery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How old are you, Mr. Montgomery?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. 30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. 9043 Anaconda, here in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Police officer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been so employed as a police officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. About 9 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have a particular rank in the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Detective.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you assigned to a particular bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Homicide and robbery bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been a detective?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. 4 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been assigned to homicide and robbery?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. 4 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you been interviewed by me prior to this deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. That little deal—that earlier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I talked to you of what? Approximately an hour, hour and
a half ago in my office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. About an hour ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how long did we talk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. About 15 or 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, have you been interviewed by any other members of the
Commission’s staff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about FBI agents or other Federal agents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I have been interviewed by the FBI; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I believe that when you and I were talking in my office
you indicated to me that you worked on Friday and Saturday, and that in
particular on Saturday you left work about 9:30 in the evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I have gone over this with you in the interview, but so
that we have continuity here, I want to start at this point. Prior to the time
that you went home Saturday night, did you hear anything from a police officer,
or bystander or newspaperman or what have you, with respect to the proposed
movement or a proposed movement of Lee Harvey Oswald to the county jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I don’t recall hearing it; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear any discussion at all or any rumors, or anything
about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, what time did you return to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, supposed to be there at 8. I was about 10 minutes
late, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, before you arrived at the police department on Sunday
<span class="locked">morning——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear anything about the proposed movement of Lee
Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Didn’t get any telephone calls with respect to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Hear anything over the radio or TV?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No. [Yes.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall now how you got to work that Sunday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Drove my car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you come in with anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall where you parked the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Not offhand, I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall entering the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. The city hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; police department building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what entrance you came through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, there are a number of entrances to the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember which of the entrances to the basement you
came through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I was trying to think. The East Commerce Street side,
coming down to the basement area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, there are a set of <span class="locked">steps——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I used the steps, not the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, does that refresh your memory in any way in terms of
where you parked your automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I parked in the vicinity of our garage over there, on Young
and Central, that is where I always park.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is a police garage at Young and Central?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes, sir; we usually park on the street out there around it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, as you walked to work from your car, did you have occasion
to go up Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I came up Commerce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall, as you came to work, whether or not there were
people outside the building or newsmen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes; at that time I didn’t think much of them out there, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see any vans parked around there, TV vans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Had a big old TV bus looking thing out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall where it was parked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. It was on Harwood, between Commerce and Main. That
would be the east side of Commerce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am a little lost on the east side. You mean the east side
of Harwood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I’m sorry. I meant Harwood. Did I say Commerce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. East side of Harwood there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you walk up Harwood part way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you happen to see that on the east side of Harwood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Of course, you can see the thing sticking out there, right
there in the intersection I guess, about 15-foot from the Commerce curb line
there.</p>

<p>And, of course, it had been there for 2 or 3 days prior to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know what TV station that van was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No, I don’t for sure. I can make a wild guess, but it
wouldn’t be any good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, are you familiar with a Bell Telephone Co. van that was
located on Harwood Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No. I—at different times there was a couple of them there.
I didn’t pay that much attention to them, what stations they was with, or anything
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you walked down those steps, do you remember anything
about whether there were any TV cables?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. There was cables there; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you know, there are three or four doors. As you get down
to the bottom of the steps one goes into the hallway that leads into the records
room, the other one, which almost faces that door and actually faces—leads
towards Commerce Street, goes down into a subbasement, and then there is
a third door which leads into the engineroom, and that third door is off to the
right as you walk down the steps. Are you familiar with those three doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I knew there was one that went down to the engineroom
and one that goes to the city hall. I don’t recall the other being there. There
very well could be. I just haven’t paid much attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As you walked in did you notice whether there were any TV
lines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Lines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Cables?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. There were some cables there. I just <span class="locked">don’t——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember the door, or the door they were strung to?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Go to the city hall, there is a double door that goes into
the city <span class="locked">hall——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is the one that goes in that hallway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about the engineroom door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I didn’t pay that much attention to it to say yea or nay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you walked in there, where did you go when you got
into the hallway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Just went to the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That’s right by the <span class="locked">record——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see anybody that you knew in the area of the basement,
other than police officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Anybody I knew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Other than police, I think just several civilians behind the
desk over there, just the records clerk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. From there did you go to the homicide bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time do you estimate you arrived at the homicide bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Probably about 10 after 8 when I got there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was there when you arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Oh, Captain Fritz and Dhority, Leavelle and Graves, and
I believe Mr. Beck and Brown was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right; did you talk to any of them when you came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Oh, I’m sure I passed the time of day with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember anything about any conversation you might
have had with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; nothing outstanding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do when you arrived there? What sort of work
did you start to do when you arrived at the homicide bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. As soon as I walked in they walked out for coffee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you went out for coffee with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; I stayed there. Of course, I had just gotten there, so,
I stayed and answered the telephones while they went out and had coffee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you continue to answer the phone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Of course when they went and drank coffee and came right
back; I guess for probably 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do when they got back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. When they got back, of course, captain told us at that time
that he was going to transfer Oswald later on and I think he said about 10, or
something like that; so he sent two of the officers out to get Oswald and bring
him down. Wanted to talk to him. I was trying to remember what two went
up after him. Anyway, two of them went up and brought him down. I don’t
remember which two it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When Fritz came out and talked about this, where were you
standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. What’s that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When he sent these two men up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes; told them to go up and get him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where were you standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Just outside of the office door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And Fritz was outside of the office door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Stepped up to the door there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he give you any instructions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; didn’t tell me anything in particular right then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is your estimate of what time that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Let’s see, approximately around 9 o’clock, somewhere
around 9.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When, between the time you arrived and the time Fritz came
out, did you talk with anybody about the possible movement of Oswald to the
county jail?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I was trying to think. No—let’s see, I don’t believe I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there any conversation in the office during that period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. While they were gone out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. While you were there, conversation that you didn’t participate in,
necessarily, but other people were talking about the movement of Oswald to the
county jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Prior to the time that Fritz asked that these two officers bring
Oswald downstairs, had you heard anything about the movement of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I think right before they told them to go up, said, “We are
going to transfer him here around 10 o’clock.” I think is what he said, and that
is when he sent a couple of officers to, you know, to get him and bring him down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was your understanding as to what was going to be done
when Oswald was brought down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Going to talk to him a little bit and transfer him, you know,
down to the county.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Up to this time, had you heard anything about a threat that
may have been made in connection with his transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear anything up to that point about how he was going
to be moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; huh-uh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you learn anything about what route might be used?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; up until the captain talked to us; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember anything else the captain told you at that
time other than that they were going to bring him down and get him ready to
move?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; said we was going to transfer him is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do while these two officers were bringing Oswald
down to Fritz’ office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I didn’t do anything outstanding. Must have been just
answer the telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, were the telephone calls that you were getting the same
kind of calls that you had been getting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Any useful information come out of these calls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do after Oswald was brought down and while
he was in Fritz’ office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, when they brought him down we stepped into this
office there and there was a—I was standing up there listening to the <span class="locked">interview——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you remain in Fritz’ office while he interviewed Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was in Fritz’ office at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. At that time, there was, of course, Captain Fritz, and there
was Oswald, and I was there, Leavelle was there and Graves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he in Fritz’ office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Graves in Fritz’ office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Uh-huh; I believe, Dhority, I believe Dhority was in there.
I am not sure, but Dhority was another one of our officers. I believe he
was in there and, of course, he had Inspector Holmes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is he the postal inspector?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes. Inspector Holmes, and I forget the man’s name for—from
the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Sorrels?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Mr. Sorrels was there, yes; and a—one other man name—was
what—who was <span class="locked">that——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there any FBI agents there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I was trying to think if Mr. Bookhout was there, but I
can’t remember if he was inside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember about what Oswald said and what was said
to Oswald during that period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I remember they asked him why he shot the President, and,
of course, he said he didn’t do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. And, I don’t recall the exact questions. Just asked him
several questions there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did this questioning last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Seemed like it was about 25 minutes or an hour that he was
in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Captain Fritz, you know, asking him questions, and he
would ask Inspector Holmes or Mr. Sorrels if they would like to ask him a
question, and, of course, they would ask him one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you been present at any of the earlier interrogations of
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; I wasn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why was it you happened to be present at this interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I think I just got lost in the office. I was in there talking
to the captain when they brought Oswald in, and, of course, the captain said,
shut the door there, and some of the officers shut the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you happen to be talking to Fritz about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I don’t recall. I know I was in his office when they brought
Oswald down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You were there for the entire period of the interrogation of
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. That morning; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember during that period anybody coming into the
office with respect to the movement of Oswald down to the county jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. The chief came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many times do you recall the chief coming in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Just recall one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long before the end of the interrogation was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I imagine it was about—well, it was right there at the end,
you know, when they was still talking, and the chief came in and wanted to
know if we were ready to move him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear Chief Curry say anything about the movement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; I didn’t hear the chief say anything, because he was
talking to the captain, and when the chief and the captain talk—they were kind
of talking low, and I wasn’t straining my ears to hear, because I know if there
was anything they wanted me to do, I know they would tell me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How big a room is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Not very big.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After this was over, did you hear anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Of course, captain told us what we were going to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did he tell you what to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. In the office there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Oswald there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did he tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. He told us we was going to, you know, transfer him to the
county jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he tell you how you were going to go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Told us we were going to use his car, the captain’s car. Said
he had an armored car down there, but they wasn’t going to use it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he tell you why he wasn’t going to use it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I think he said it was too big and bulky.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he tell you what route you were going to take?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Going to leave the basement, Commerce, Central, right
straight up Main.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you aware of an earlier plan to take him by way of Elm
Street rather than Main?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. He said that the armored car was supposed to go up Elm
Street and act as a decoy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What else did he tell you about how he was going to be moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Of course, he said, no; he wanted Graves on one side and
Leavelle on the other, and wanted Leavelle to handcuff himself to Oswald there
so he wouldn’t get away, and said, “I’ll lead the way out.” And told me, said,
“I want you to follow behind Oswald,” which I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he tell you what you were supposed to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Huh?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he tell you what you were supposed to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Make sure he didn’t get away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there some concern that Oswald might try to get away?
Was this actually discussed, the possibility that Oswald might try to escape?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I don’t know that there was anything actually discussed
about him trying to get away. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you have the feeling that he might try to break away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; I didn’t have a feeling that he would try, but he just
said to stay there with him and make sure he doesn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, did you feel that your reason, your primary reason for
being behind him was to prevent him from getting away rather than to prevent
somebody from getting to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Keep him from getting away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did anybody explain to you before you went downstairs what
the press setup was going to be in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, they explained to me—no; because they told me what
I was supposed to do, and that is all. They didn’t say anything about the press.
I heard the captain say that the big cameras was supposed to be back behind the
rail there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear anything said about where news personnel was
supposed to be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; I remember they said the news media were down there.
No one was down there except news media and officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you remember any preparation that you made up in the
office to take Oswald down to the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, he put on a black sweater. I think he changed shirts,
changed shirts, and put on a black sweater. The captain asked him about
something, if he wanted to wear a hat, and he said, “No.” And, of course, they
handcuffed him and handcuffed Leavelle to him. Now, other than that that is
all I remember about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, as you walked out of the homicide office you went into the
hallway on the third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And there were news people out there, or were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I don’t recall seeing any out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh. How about TV people? Do you recall seeing any TV
people in the hallway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Didn’t see any there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. You got in the hallway, then did you turn left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Turned left; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you went to the area where it is sort of a foyer near the
public elevators?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; a prisoner elevator we went down on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You walked down the hallway to the left, and then you <span class="locked">turned——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Went inside the jail elevator door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. That is only, I guess, about—I guess about 20 foot from
the homicide office to that door, or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have to wait for the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I unlocked the door and go inside and locked the door
behind you and—on that particular occasion, I believe the elevator was waiting
on us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What happened when you got down in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, we got off the elevator and walked around in front
of the booking desk there. You want me to show you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me get a—I’m going to mark this “Dallas, Texas, March 24,
Detective L. D. Montgomery’s deposition. March 24, 1964, Exhibit 5004.”
Now, I want to show you what has been marked as Exhibit 5004, which is a
diagram of the basement area of the Police and Courts Building. Would you
want to explain to us what you did there? Let me give you this pen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. This is, of course—it shows the jail elevator. This is
the elevator we came down on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Came down in the jail elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Uh-huh, and of course, we came on the elevator here and I
was of the first out of the elevator, because I was last, one of the last on, so,
of course, I just stepped back here to the back and waited for all of them
to get out, and when they got out I took my position right in behind Oswald.
Of course, we came around to the left here [indicating]. Around to this door
here [indicating]. Out—went out into <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, let me state for the record that you are indicating on
the map that you walked around in front of the counter of the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. To the jail office doors which lead to the hallway just before
you get to the ramps in the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay; what happened when you got to that door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. When we got to the door, Captain Fritz told us to stop.
He was going to check one more time the security.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me interrupt you here. Before you left the homicide
bureau, did anybody notify you that the area was secured?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. The chief—well, they didn’t notify—Captain Fritz told
me that—told all of us that he had been advised that it was secure down
there and they was ready for us to come down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he tell you who told him that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; he didn’t say for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was Chief Curry at the time that you people got that
notice up in the homicide bureau, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Now, I don’t know whether—where he was at. He left
there. He left our office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long before you got that notice did Chief Curry leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. How long before we got the notice did he leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Oh, I would say probably 5 or 10 minutes, because I know
after he left they went ahead and put the sweater and shirt on Oswald and
handcuffed him and everything, so, I imagine at least 5 or 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you approached the jail office door, what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Captain Fritz stepped out into this door leading out to
the ramp, and, of course, I didn’t—I could not hear who he was talking to or
what he said, but just stepped back and told us, “Come on.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Then we walked out the door there to—well, walked out
to where—well, where the shooting happened, and we had to stop, because
our car wasn’t in position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you actually stop or did you slow up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No—well, we may have just slowed up, I guess. We just
slowed up because it was only things like just there a second.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, as you slowed up, did you get a look at the news media?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Didn’t get much of a look at anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you able to tell where the TV cameras were located?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I assume they were over here, because all you could see
was a glare of lights. You couldn’t see anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, over to your left as the Main Street ramp comes down,
were you able to tell how many rows deep the newspaper people were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; I couldn’t tell about how many rows there were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right; now, what happened after you slowed up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, can I back up here just a second.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Coming out this door here—[indicating] evidently several
news media over in this area here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you are pointing to the area on the <span class="locked">map——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Be the north wall here [indicating]——</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you place “X’s” on the map where you think you saw
newspaper people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Looked to me all along right in here [indicating] because as
soon as we came out this door, well, the—this bunch here just moved in on us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. You want to—will you put those “X’s”? You want to
make a little note, “Newspapermen,” or “news”——</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Like I say, they moved in towards us and had those long-looking
microphones and cramming them over there in Oswald’s face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there any police officers at the point where you have marked
those “X’s”, holding them back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. It could have been. I didn’t recognize them. Very well
could have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Like I say, we came out there. They crammed those
mikes over there, and we had to slow up for just a second, because they was
backing this car into position. It was supposed to have been in position when we
got there, but it wasn’t there, so, we had to pause, or slow down for the car
to come on back. And, of course, this pause there—Captain Fritz opened the
door of the car. He walked up to the door there. I don’t say he opened the
door or not. I didn’t see him open the door. He just walked up to it and then
I saw a blur or something and I couldn’t tell what it was. I couldn’t tell, and
I heard what sounded like a shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. <span class="locked">And——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. And <span class="locked">then——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear anybody say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. There was—just fixing to say there was just kind of a roar,
you know, people hollering and everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Before you heard this shot, did you hear anybody say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. All these newspaper reporters were hollering, “Why did you
shoot the President?” And all that stuff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Back on the record. Now, what did you say happened when you
heard the shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, Officer Graves was on Oswald’s left and I went around
Officer Graves to try to help get—and, of course, when I got around there
several officers had hold of him, and I grabbed him around the throat, and was
applying a choke hold on him, and, of course, we drug him off to one side over
on the cement there on the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of struggle was he putting up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. He was putting up a struggle—with so many officers on him,
it wasn’t too much, could have—couldn’t have been too much.</p>

<p>First time we put him down it was right here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, don’t put an “X” there. Block that “X” off. Make a
circle, or something. You want to put a little arrow to that and say it was
Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Right here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay; now, what did you do when you got him down on the
cement at that spot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. As soon as we got him down here we made a—I didn’t—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>some
of the other officers was making a search for the pistol, and “Blackie”
Harrison was standing there and we had—held him down on the ground, and
I told Ruby—not Ruby—told “Blackie” Harrison, “Better get him inside the jail
office.” At which time we all picked him up and brought him inside the jail
office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear “Blackie” say anything either before or after
the shooting, or during the struggle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Not that I recall, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Then you all took him inside <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Uh-huh. Brought him right in here. Laid him down
on the floor just inside the door there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was he doing at that point? Still putting up a struggle
<span class="locked">or——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. We laid him down on the floor there. He hollered and said,
“You all know me. I’m Jack Ruby.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know how he happened to yell that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Do I know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; did you hear anybody holler anything to him at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I don’t remember hearing anything. Hollered—says,
“You all know me. I’m Jack Ruby.” And then we let him down there and
was looking for the pistol.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I said—I said, “Where is the pistol at?” And Officer—Detective
Graves walked up to where I was and said, “I have got the pistol
right here.” And pulled it out of his pocket and showed it to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you search him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, was he searched while he was in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, everybody’s hands were going all over him; so, I
am sure they were searching.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were his pockets turned out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; they didn’t actually turn them wrong side out; no,
because everything would have fell out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do at that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, after Graves showed us where the pistol was, of
course, we knew that he didn’t have it on him then. Then Chief Batchelor
walked by here. Chief Batchelor is our assistant chief of police, and I asked
if he wanted Ruby—to get Ruby in the jail, and he said, “Yes.”</p>

<p>We then picked up Ruby and came around the corner here to the jail office.
I mean the jail elevator there, and they took him upstairs to the jail, and I
returned over to where Captain Fritz and Graves, Leavelle were with Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was “they” that took him upstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, “Blackie” Harrison and Archer, McMillon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Clardy with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Clardy was down there if he wasn’t with them—I just
don’t know. I know there was four or five of them there that went up, Cutchshaw,
Lowery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do <span class="locked">after——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, we went back over to where Oswald was. The
ambulance came in and we—of course, they picked up the stretcher that he
was on and took it to the ambulance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. And several of the detectives got inside the ambulance
and went with the ambulance to Parkland. I went over and got in Captain
Fritz’ car, Beck and Captain Fritz and Brown and myself went out to Parkland
Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do when you got to Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, first got there, of course, we went into the emergency
room and they took Oswald back to one of the emergency treatment
rooms, and we—or some captain told us to watch the doors, you know, make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
sure no one came in or went out other than doctors and nurses, which we did
that until they transferred him up to the operating room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, at Parkland Hospital did you hear any rumors about
how Ruby got into the station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, I don’t know if I heard it out there or where.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. <span class="locked">Now——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I guess I did. I probably heard it out at Parkland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it that what you are about to talk about is the first
rumor that you heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. About the only one I ever heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. He just walked down there as one of the officers was
backing the car out. There was a car down there that had to back out the
Main Street ramp. As they were backing it out, the officers that were lined
up here on the ramp right here [indicating] as security, were assisting this
car out, because the ramp was coming, you know, the wrong way there. And
they were assisting that car out. Evidently went down there then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There were a number of rumors that were circulating. Did
you ever hear the rumor that he got in with the press pass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; I—not press pass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear any rumor that he got out of a police car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; I hadn’t heard that one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever hear the rumor that he came in with some TV
cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes; I heard that he picked up one and brought it down
there. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, trying to probe your memory, try to tell us exactly as
you can just what you knew, or what rumors you heard at Parkland Hospital
and if you don’t really have an accurate memory about it at all, I would
like to know when you feel most certain that you knew something about how
Ruby got into the jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I don’t recall exactly when I heard the rumor; how he got
down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain in Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I guess an hour. We were there an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, now, when you left, of course, you—you knew Ruby, you
had known him for some time, so, when you left the jail, of course you knew who
the guy was who had shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you got out to Parkland Hospital, do you remember
anybody who was out there asking questions about any other officers, or asking
questions about who it was that shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; I don’t remember anybody asking me anything about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear conversation out at Parkland Hospital that would
have identified Ruby as the person who shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; I didn’t hear anybody out there saying, you know, that
Ruby shot Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk to any reserve officers out there at Parkland
Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; I don’t believe I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As you took Oswald out to Parkland Hospital, was it generally
known among all the people who were escorting Oswald to Parkland that Ruby
had been the guy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, of course, I was in the car with Captain Fritz, Beck,
and Brown, and as far as any ambulance, where Oswald was, I don’t know if
<span class="locked">it——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All the people in your car knew it was Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; Captain Fritz didn’t know who it was. They didn’t
know each other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He knew the name of the man who had shot Oswald was Ruby
at that time, didn’t he?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes, he knew that. We discussed it there in the car
that—going out to the hospital—that Jack Ruby shot him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you took Oswald into Parkland Hospital—were there people
asking you who shot him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No, because I didn’t go in with the body—I say, “the
body”—Oswald. Of course when the ambulance—beat us to the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As you people went into the hospital, were there people asking
you who <span class="locked">shot——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. People doing a lot of talking. I don’t know if they were
asking questions or what, because we weren’t paying a lot of attention to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If somebody had asked you who shot Oswald, might you have
said Ruby did it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; I wouldn’t have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I might explain to you what I am getting at. We know that
somewhere along the line somebody was out at Parkland Hospital who was a
newspaperman <span class="locked">at——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Learned that Ruby was the person. This started a rumor to the
effect that his informant must have had something to do with it, and I am really
asking you this question to see if it isn’t possible that you guys, as you guys
got out to Parkland, somebody had said Ruby was the guy and just by dropping
the words, you know, that would spread like wildfire out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; I didn’t say anything about who it was that done the
shooting, out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time did you arrive back at the homicide bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. What time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Approximately 1:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And when you got back to the homicide bureau, do you remember
having any conversation with anybody about how Ruby got into the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, no; I didn’t talk to anybody. Just, you know—I
guess we was all standing out asking each other how in the world did he get in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After Ruby shot Oswald on the 24th, did you see Ruby at any
time the rest of that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes, sir; we brought him down for the captain to talk to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About what time was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Probably around 2, because we had been there at the hospital—I
mean office, about 30 minutes, went up and brought him down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did he stay down here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I didn’t carry him back, so, I don’t know for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you present during any of that interrogation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Not with Ruby; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the time you brought him down, did you know how Ruby
got into the basement or had you been told?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I still don’t know how he got down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But, had you heard, put it this way, had you heard at that
point that Ruby had told somebody how he got into the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I don’t think so. I don’t think I would have been aware of
it then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you remain in the office with Ruby and Fritz for any length
of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Who brought Ruby down with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Let’s see, it was Detectives Boyd and Hall. They sat in
on the interrogation there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you got up to see Ruby, how was Ruby dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Up in the jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. He had on his shirt, and his skivvies.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what other officers were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I can’t say for sure but it seems like Archer was there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
but I couldn’t say for sure. I don’t know. There was an FBI agent there,
too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know which agent that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Oh, Agent Hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I think—I don’t—you are giving your answer. I think you are
right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I think that is who it was. I don’t know if they have got an
agent named Hall, but seemed to me like that is what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Sergeant Dean there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, there again, I couldn’t say, “yea or nay,” because
I don’t recall who was there exactly. I remember an FBI agent there, and
Archer—I believe Archer was there. Dean could have been there. He could
have been in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is it your best recollection that there was more than one? That
there was somebody else in that cell there besides Hall, Ruby, and Archer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I believe there was. I believe there was a jail guard there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Anybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No, <span class="locked">but——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you indicating that you just don’t remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I just don’t remember for sure how many was in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was anything said to you by any of the people with Ruby when
you went up to the jail to get him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; they didn’t say anything to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did they pass on any information about anything Ruby had said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; did you people talk at all with Ruby as you brought him
downstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I’m sure we did, and I am trying to remember what we said.
Let’s see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, now, you knew Ruby. Did you try to get him to open
up on the way down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; I didn’t. Usually when we are bringing a prisoner
down I don’t try to talk to them too much. I don’t want to upset anything,
you know, any plans he has to talk to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did Captain Fritz know that you were acquainted with
Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. He knew when I told him; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you tell him that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. As we was going out to Parkland Hospital. He kept saying,
“Who is Jack Ruby?” And I told him, “He is a man that runs the Club
Vegas out on Oak Lawn.”</p>

<p>Asked me did I know him, I said, “Yes; I used to have a district for about
4 years out there.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you feel that if you would talk to Ruby, that Ruby might
have been willing to give you any information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; because Ruby and I, first of all, weren’t that close or
anything. As a matter of fact, I don’t guess he even remembers my name or
face, either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. But he was used to seeing officers come in his place. I
don’t imagine he would remember one any more than others—another.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did any of the officers up there at the jail cell with Ruby when
you went up there to get him come down on the elevator with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I believe Hall, FBI Agent Hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did Hall go into Captain Fritz’ office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Now, our Detective Hall rather than Agent Hall did. I
just don’t know, because I couldn’t say for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who do you remember being in Fritz’ office the first time, or—on
this occasion when Ruby was brought down by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, I know that Captain Fritz, Ruby, and, of course,
Detectives Hall and Boyd—Detective M. G. Hall. I know they were there
for sure, and who else was there I couldn’t swear, because I just saw them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
walk up to the door to Captain Fritz’ office. And they went in, of course,
the blinds were drawn in Fritz’ office, so, I couldn’t see who was in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do after they took Ruby into Fritz’ office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, I sat down and answered some more of them phone
calls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I don’t recall anything outstanding from then on. I know
I didn’t get off until, have to look at my notebook again. Yes; seemed to me
about 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you take Ruby back upstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; I didn’t take him back upstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; I didn’t take him back upstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see him taken back upstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; I, evidently, was in the squad room at the time he
was taken back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see Ruby brought back down a second time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; I didn’t, not that day; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you in the homicide bureau the entire time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. In and out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you out for any period as long as 10 or 15 minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, I talked to one witness back for, I guess for about
20 or 30 minutes. The way our office is set up they could have carried him
in and taken him back out without some of them sitting back in the squad room
ever seeing him come in or go out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This first occasion when you brought Ruby down, was Agent
Sorrels of the Secret Service in Fritz’ office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I couldn’t say for sure, because those blinds were drawn
to the captain’s office, and I couldn’t see who all was in there. I walked up
to the door. I could see Captain Fritz, and Hall and Boyd stepped on inside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. At 10:30—I left at 10:30 Sunday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Prior to 10:30, I take it you answered; you didn’t see Ruby
again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Not that Sunday; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Did you talk—did you see Archer again on that
Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Archer and them, let’s see, were in our office, when we
got back from the hospital—Archer and Harrison, Cutchshaw and Lowery were
all in the office when we got back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there any discussion in there about how Ruby got into
the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I think there was some—somebody say, “How did he get
down here?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what was said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, of course, nobody knew for sure. Said, “Well, no
telling how he got in.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see Archer after that other than when you saw him
up in the jail cell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Not that day. I don’t believe Archer was in our office. I
know Harrison and Cutchshaw and Lowery were in there, and McMillon was
upstairs with Archer, because I remember now in the scuffle down here in
apprehending Jack Ruby, McMillon lost his hat, and, of course, I thought
it was Ruby’s hat, so, I was hanging onto it, you know, and on the way to
Parkland I looked inside and T. D. McMillon’s initials were in it, so, upon our
arrival back from Parkland Hospital to the office, I went down to McMillon’s
office and left his hat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk with Harrison at all about how Ruby got in,
Blackie Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I don’t believe I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk with Lowery at all about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, like I say, we were all back there in that squad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
room, and somebody said, “How did he get down there?” And I don’t know
who said—well, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Didn’t Lowery say at that point that he thought Ruby pushed a
TV camera in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I couldn’t swear that he did or didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you, Cutchshaw, Lowery, and Harrison remain
in the homicide office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Didn’t stay there but just a few minutes. I know when
we left they were in there writing out a report of some kind. Didn’t even ask
them what they was writing. Sitting there writing something. Anyway, after
I talked to them just as—just a second, I went back to where Captain Fritz
was, and that was when they sent us back upstairs to get Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Hall, Harrison, Cutchshaw and Lowery are all from the juvenile
bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you talk with Dean at all on Sunday after <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Gene?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Dean. Officer Dean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk with Officer McMillon at all after the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Seemed like I talked to him later on that night and told
him about his hat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall him telling you anything about how Ruby got in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you knew that McMillon had been up there in this jail
cell with Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ask him anything about what Ruby was saying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; I didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he tell you anything about what Ruby was saying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Archer? Did you see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I don’t believe—I don’t recall seeing Archer any more
after they left <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. I want you to take the pen back from me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And I want to mark these two documents for identification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And I am going to mark this one Exhibit 5005, and the second
one Exhibit 5006.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And each of them, “Dallas, Texas, Detective Montgomery’s deposition.
3-24-64”. These are copies of FBI reports?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And they represent, of <span class="locked">course——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Their interview with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Their interview with you; yes. Now, I am going to ask you
to look at 5005. This purports to be an interview that was made on December 4,
1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. By James Kennedy and Leo Robertson of <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. With who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. With you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I didn’t talk to no two. I talked to one. I talked to Mr.
Bookhout and one other agent is all. Let’s see. Maybe I had better read this
before I start talking. Let’s see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Look it over and tell me if you remember that interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. “Stated they had known Ruby for several years.” That
must mean “he.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Tell you what. Let’s take a break here and let Officer Montgomery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
read this over, and then I want to know whether you feel that there
should be any additions or corrections made in it.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I will hand you what has been marked as Exhibit 5005 and
5006. Have you had a chance to look those over, Mr. Montgomery?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there anything you want to add to those statements that you
haven’t told us already?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you want to make any corrections in those statements, in
light of what you have said today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, on this one right here, Mr. Griffin, it said, “He states
they had known Ruby for several years.” I don’t know who “they” would be.
See on that second paragraph where it says, “He stated they——”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You want to change that to “he”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Uh-huh. That is the only thing I see in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. Let me look it over for just a second. I notice in here
that you stated that you felt that you hadn’t seen Ruby for at least 2 years
prior to the time of the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. That is what I was thinking about. Anywhere from a
year, year and a half, to 2 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Your best recollection is for a year, or year and a half?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Probably was a year and a half. My partner—after I gave
that to the agent there, this partner advised me that one night we were driving
down Commerce Street and Jack pulled up beside of us and spoke to us in his
car. I don’t recall seeing him, but my partner told me he—that we had seen
him there. That shouldn’t have been too long before all this happened. I
guess two or <span class="locked">three——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was your partner that told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. It was Mr. Johnson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What’s his first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Marvin Johnson, but I don’t recall seeing Ruby then, at
that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You stated in here, I think it is 5006—at least it’s reported that
as you “brought Oswald down into the jail area the two officers with Oswald
between them and Montgomery hesitated before going into this corridor while
Capt. J. W. Fritz checked with Chief——to see if the area was clear.” Agent
Bookhout hasn’t indicated here what chief that was. Are you able to fill in
that blank?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, actually what that was was I told him, “Chief,” say
who did the captain talk to when he stepped out that door. I couldn’t see. I
just told him I thought it was the chief. I didn’t know. I didn’t—maybe it
wasn’t even a chief that he talked to. It was some lieutenant out there that
told him, that is why I say at that particular time I was hesitant on this. This
“chief” business then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have anything else that you want to tell us that we
haven’t already covered that you think might be of use to the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Oh, well, I don’t know of anything. Looks like you all
have covered it pretty well, and, of course, these reports here have it, too. One
thing they say is not in here either. It is not—I haven’t told you yet, is when
we had Ruby down on the floor inside the jail office there, that while we had
him down and was holding him on the floor there he said he hoped he killed the
s.o.b.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You heard him say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes; of course, there were other officers that heard it, too.
We was all standing right there. That is the one thing that wasn’t in this
report here. I don’t recall seeing it, do you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you testify in the Jack Ruby trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; I never did testify.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I think maybe one last thing. If you would look over this map,
now, and if you feel that the marks that we’ve put on here are accurate on the
basis of what we have done before, I would like you to sign it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Right here, let me put “news media,” right below that so
that I will know as well as someone else might know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. Sign it, if you would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Over here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That would be fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. You want me to date it or anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; that’s all right. We have got it on the record here. “The
reporter will say witness signs an exhibit.”</p>

<p>All right. Okay. That concludes our interview, and thank you.</p>

<h2 id="McMILLON">TESTIMONY OF THOMAS DONALD McMILLON</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of Thomas Donald McMillon was taken at 10:30 a.m., on
March 25, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan
and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Burt W. Griffin, assistant counsel of
the President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How are you? Sit down over here, Tom. I want to explain to
you what we are doing here. Like I said, my name is Burt Griffin and I am a
member of the advisory staff to the General Counsel of the President’s Commission
investigating the assassination of President Kennedy. This Commission
has been set up by virtue of an order of President Johnson, Executive Order
11130, dated November 29, 1963, and also under Joint Resolution of Congress 137.
Pursuant to these documents, there have been a series of rules of procedure
enacted, and pursuant to those rules of procedure, I have been authorized to
take a sworn deposition from Officer McMillon here. I want to say initially
that the general nature of the Commission’s inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate,
report upon the facts that relate to the assassination of President Kennedy, also,
of course, the subsequent death of Lee Harvey Oswald. As far as you are
concerned, Mr. McMillon, we are primarily concerned here with the death of
Oswald; although, if there is any other information that you have that you
think would be pertinent to this inquiry, we would certainly appreciate your
coming forward with it. Now, we have asked you to come here today through
a general request, which was made by the General Counsel of the President’s
Commission, addressed in a letter to Chief Curry. Actually, under the rules
adopted by the Commission, you are entitled to have a 3-day written notice of
any appearance for this purpose, and, however, there is also a provision that
you may waive this written notice if you want to, and I ask you right now if
you would prefer to have us give you a written notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or do you want to waive it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No; I will waive that. It is okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you are also permitted to be represented by counsel here,
and I assume, since you haven’t come with an attorney, that it is your desire
not to have one, but if you do desire one, tell me at this point. Tell me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t feel like I need an attorney here present now, but I
want to reserve the right to have counsel if I feel like I need it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Certainly you have that right at that time, and I mean to cover
that. I also mean to tell you that this is not—we are not involved in a trial,
we have no authority to prosecute anybody for any crime. All of that is to be
handled by the State of Texas. The only crime that can be committed in connection
with this investigation is perjury, and it is very, very important that we
find out all of the facts that surround this and find them out truthfully. This
investigation is more important, I think, than anybody can really realize to the
national security, and if there is any way that I can impress upon you the
importance of this, that our interest is getting the truth for this purpose and
our interest is not in going out and trying to put anybody in jail or anything
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. All right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If you are willing to be sworn to testify, I would appreciate
your raising your right hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give
is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Will you give us your full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Thomas Donald McMillon. It is [spelling] M-c-M-i-l-l-o-n.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. One April 1935.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where do you live now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. 4929 Reiger Street, Apartment 109.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I am a police officer for the city of Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you in any particular division?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes; I am a detective assigned to the auto theft investigation
bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And do you have any particular rank?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Detective.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been in the auto theft bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Nearly 11 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you been in any other bureaus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Patrol division prior to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And when you were in the patrol division, whom did you work
under?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. My last captain of patrol was Capt. C. E. Talbert, I believe
it is, Talbert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Talbert. And, at that time, whose direct supervision were
you under?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. My last sergeant was Sgt. H. A. Amos.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever work under Sergeant Dean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you work under Sergeant Dean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. The exact dates, I don’t recall, but I did work the downtown
area while he was the supervisor in that area, in that zone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. And in connection with that employment, did you become
acquainted with Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I have seen Jack in the downtown area. I believe that I
have probably answered calls to this Carousel Club down here. I knew him
prior to that, not personally, but I had answered calls at the Vegas Club when
he ran that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Do you recall when it was that you worked out at the
Vegas Club area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Some in 1957 and probably 1958. I am not exactly sure
on those dates, but it should have been in that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know Eva Grant when you were out there in the Vegas
Club area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I have seen her. I don’t know her personally. I believe
I have seen her in the Vegas Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Pauline Hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No. I don’t know Pauline Hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you worked the downtown area, did you know
George Senator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t know George Senator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, did you know the bartender at the Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was the last time that you worked the downtown area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Most all of my time in patrol was spent, or the majority
of it, was spent in the downtown area. I believe about 8 or 9 or maybe 10
months before I was promoted to a detective, I worked an area of the downtown—one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
of the downtown districts. I believe in August of 1962, the first
of August 1962, I went to what we refer to kindly of a South Dallas beat.
Actually, it is on the edge of downtown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. And most of my time spent on patrol was downtown or in
the downtown area or near by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you on duty Friday, November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where were you at the time you learned that President Kennedy
had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Home, in bed, asleep.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, you weren’t sleeping. Did somebody wake you up to
tell you that the President had been shot? Did somebody wake you up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes. Phone call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who called you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. A friend of mine did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. He came to my house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Mickey Fuller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you stay home all day Friday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Except probably maybe to go out to eat. I was there most
of the day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you report—did you report for work on Friday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that your regular day off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I reported at 7 a.m. Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you go down to the police department at any time on
Friday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall, did you visit the scene, did you visit the School
Book Depository or any particular places on the 22d, other than your home,
that you can recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No; I didn’t go down near that <span class="locked">Depository——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Or down near the police station or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh. Did you see anything on the 22d that might be of value
to the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. The only thing that I saw was what events that I saw on
television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, on the 23d, when you arrived at work, where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. To the auto theft bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you work in the auto theft bureau all day Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes; until 3 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What I mean to say is, did you go out of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t recall if I did or not. Maybe I might have gone out
for coffee. It seemed to me like I had lunch in the locker room that day. I
am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that on the third floor of the police department building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. The locker room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No, no; the auto theft bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see anybody in the police department that day who
was—who you recognized as not being a police officer or a newsman or somebody
who was there visiting your department on official business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Well, I don’t know how to answer that. There were a lot
of people there. Some of them were in and out. People at first started out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
during that day coming to our office to get automobiles released from the
pound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. People in and out like that, and I saw a number of people
that I didn’t know, and I didn’t see identification on them and didn’t recognize
them as probably being newsmen or with the press or some news media.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was your office in the auto theft bureau used by the news people
for any purposes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes. They used our phones quite often.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did this cause you problems?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you give some idea of what kind of problems these news
people were causing you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Well, our phones were pretty well tied up. There seemed to
be quite a commotion in and around and about the office. It made it difficult
to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh. Did you people attempt to make any effort to get these
news people out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. We were cooperative with them. If they asked to use a
phone and if there was a phone available, we extended them every courtesy
along that line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh. Did you see Jack Ruby at any time on Friday or
Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And, as I understand, you left work on Saturday about 3 in
the afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you left work on Saturday, did you have any idea that
Lee Harvey Oswald would be moved from the county jail the next day—to
the county jail the next day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No. I may or may not have heard any rumors, I don’t
remember, but I didn’t know when he would be moved. I had heard some
rumors, I believe, but I didn’t know when he would be moved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After work that night, did you have any occasion to be around
the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do Saturday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t recall. The best I remember, it seemed to me like I
stayed home and watched television. I may have gone out, but I think I stayed
home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time did you report for work on Sunday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. 7 a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember where you parked your car Sunday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I am sure it is the same parking lot that I always park on.
I park on a pay lot at the corner of Main and Pearl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you parked, which corner did you park on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. It would be the southeast corner of Main and Pearl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is actually between Main and Commerce, isn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Huh-uh. Well, you might consider it that way. Can I use
some paper here to show you what I mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. Take this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Okay. This would be Pearl Expressway, the directions, your
north and south.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Main Street running—okay. This was actually the way the
streets were running.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Main running east and west, Commerce running east and
west, and, of course, here is Pearl going south.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. On here, will you mark a mark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Right over here, right in here is where I parked my car,
this parking lot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. Where you just placed an “X”? I am going to mark
this, if I can, mark this “Dallas, Tex., Detective T. D. McMillon.” That is
[spelling] M-i-l-l-o-n, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. 3-25-64, Exhibit 5015. At the time you arrived for work,
was there a police officer stationed at the corner of Main and Pearl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t recall whether there was or wasn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, from that parking lot, Mr. McMillon, how did you get into
the police department? Did you walk down Main or Commerce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Down Main.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you—how did you go, in the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No. I probably took the first floor elevator, elevator, first
floor. I usually do. That particular day, I recall I walked down this ramp,
but I don’t recall whether I took the steps and went up to the first floor and
went up the elevator. That is the way I usually go in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You go into the city hall, as opposed to the municipal building,
there is a set of steps going up into the police building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And then, when you arrived, were there any people congregated
around the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Not that I recall. I don’t know if there was or not. I don’t
recall there being any there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there any other cars parked in the parking lot when you
arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes; I am sure there was. I don’t know whose or which ones.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you recognize Jack Ruby’s car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I haven’t seen Jack’s car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do when you got up to the auto theft bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t know. Probably the first thing I did, probably take
my coat off and go get a cup of coffee, bring it back out of the machine. That is
my normal habit or routine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there a machine up on the third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is it just in the auto theft bureau or is it accessible?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No. There is a little lounge that is accessible to the public.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And do the police officers normally take a coffee break in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Not normally, but you may occasionally see some in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where do the police officers normally go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Martin’s or the Majestic. Of course, Martin’s wouldn’t be
open on Sunday, I don’t think. Wherever you can go. You might possibly go
to the locker room, if you wanted to. There is a coffee machine down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh. Do you remember what you did up until the time that
you were asked to go down into the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I tried to work on some of my cases, the best I could. I don’t
remember whether I was trying to contact some complainants by phone or
whether I had checked some prisoners out of the jail, was working out on
prisoners, exactly what I was doing. I know I was working in the office when
Lieutenant Smart came through and said, “Don’t anybody leave.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember any of the cases that you worked on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Huh-uh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you busy answering telephone calls from people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes; I answered some phone calls from people. Yes, sir; I
sure did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you get any phone calls in connection with the murder of the
President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You didn’t get any of these crank calls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No; I didn’t take any crank calls. I sure didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you got up there, what other officers were on duty in the
auto theft bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Well, now, let’s see. I recall I was on duty, Lieutenant Smart,
Detective Clardy. That is my partner. Detective Rivers was working at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
desk, what we call the desk. I was working in the auto theft. He is the one
that was making out the assignments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it Clardy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No; it wasn’t Clardy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Ed Rivers. Archer and Greeson were on duty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How do you spell that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I believe that boy spells it [spelling] G-r-e-e-s-o-n, and then
I don’t recall if they were there, but they were on duty this day. Detective
Watson, Detective Dawson, and I don’t remember who the others were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you arrived for duty, did you know that Jack Ruby
was—did you know that Lee Oswald might be moved that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No. I personally felt that he might, but I didn’t know that
he would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you arrived for duty, at any time after you arrived
and before Oswald was shot, did you hear that someone had called during the
night and threatened to get Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No; not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you people in the auto theft bureau, did you talk about the
expected movement of Oswald that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes; the best I remember, we probably did, theories and
opinions, probably. I don’t recall how the conversation went.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall whether at any time prior to the time that Lieutenant
Smart asked you to go downstairs there was any discussion as to when
Ruby—Oswald would be moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t recall any discussions. After he told us that, I still
continued busy at something, and I remember that I was the last one out of the
office when we all started to leave to go down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you arrived down in the office, when you walked out of
your office, did you see any police officers in the hall that you recognized?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who did you see out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t recall who they were. You are speaking of the
third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t recall who they were. I would have known most of
those men, but I recall seeing some that I recognized. Right now, I don’t
recall who they were, but I remember seeing them and recognizing them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember who you went down on the elevator with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I believe most of them were the men from my office and
some more, the best I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember if you went down with men from the other
bureaus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes; there probably were some detectives from the other
bureaus. I don’t recall who they were now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Now, was there anybody in charge of this general
movement going downstairs, was there one man going around rounding everybody
up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t know. I felt like I was under the supervision of
Lieutenant Smart until I later learned that there was a man ranking to him
down there who was giving orders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you got downstairs, where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. From the—I got off of the elevator and walked straight
through two swinging doors and just outside of the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So you were between the swinging doors and the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, were all of the police officers sort of out there waiting or
were they spread out on both sides of those swinging doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Well, we later had spread out on both sides of the doors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, at the time that you came down, was there a general
meeting held outside of the swinging doors?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. There seemed to be to me, and a few minutes later, Captain
Jones told us what he wanted done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. But when you congregated outside of those swinging
doors, it was everybody sort of milling around, nobody giving instructions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. It was right at first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you see W. J. Harrison down there when you were outside
of the swinging doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. At what point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At that point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t recall if I saw him at that point or not, but I saw
him down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall anybody that you saw down there as you
congregated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. When we first arrived down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t know who all was down there. I know we were from
the auto theft bureau. I recall Captain Jones being there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, from the time that you got down there and taking the
time that you were milling around in front of the swinging doors, how long
was it from then until Lee Oswald was brought down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I would say about 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had the armored car been brought in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I have to assume that the armored car was in the position
that it was, since I have since learned what I have. As I recall, I never did
see the armored car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You just don’t have any recollection of seeing it at all that
day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t remember seeing that armored car at all. I may
have, but I sure don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were the TV cameras moved while you were down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. There was some TV cameras placed in position while we
were there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were they moved out of one position to another while you were
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I think I know what you mean. We had those people move
back over kind of in the mouthway to this deal, which would have been in my
position that I finally took up, just moments before the shooting, the position
that I was in then. Anyway, we had moved or had instructed those people to
move back over, which would have been to my right. I will correct that. Left.
This is my left hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. Now, let me ask you this. When you walked—went down
there and were waiting before anybody gave you any instructions, did you see a
TV camera on the jail office side of the railing, anywhere between the railing and
the jail office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. It seems to me like I did, but I can’t be sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, do you remember whether a camera was moved from a
position somewhere near the swinging doors back away across the ramp and
behind the railing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes; it seems to me like I do, but I wasn’t paying any attention,
because it seemed to me like there was cameras everywhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, there finally came a time when somebody gave
you some instructions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Captain Jones, and, of course, Lieutenant Smart was assisting
him, but Captain Jones explained to us that, when they brought the prisoner
out, that he wanted two lines formed and we were to keep these two lines
formed, you know, a barrier on either side of them, kind of an aisle. We were
kind of to make an aisle for them to walk through, and when they came down
this aisle, we were to keep this line intact and move along with them until the
man was placed in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So you were sort of supposed to pick him up as a flanker?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. That was my understanding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh. Now, did—were you assigned to any position, to take
up any particular position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No; the man told us what he wanted and everybody just set
it up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, was Detective Harrison or Blackie Harrison, was he present
when Jones gave these instructions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I am sure that he was. I don’t know if he was or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how about Detective L. D. Miller, was he present at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t know at what point Miller had got there. I am sure
that he was, because Miller had taken up the position. When we set up, Miller
had taken up the position on my right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain—well, let me ask you this: After
Jones finished giving instructions, where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I was there in that area, and I took my position outside of
the jail office door there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you immediately take up the position that you had when
Oswald was shot or did you move around?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No; I believe I had a different position there for a minute,
and I saw that the space over here needed another officer in it, so I got over
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain in that position before Oswald came
down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. It seemed to me like about 10 minutes. I am not sure of the
time. It was possibly somewhere in that neighborhood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, was Detective Miller in his position when you
came—when you took your position, took up your position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t recall if he was already in position or if he moved
in after I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much of the time that you were in your position would be
your best estimate that Miller was also there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Five to 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see Miller leave that position at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. If he did, I don’t remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, Miller was on your right, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, would you—I am going to mark this map first of all. This
is a diagram of the jail basement area, and I am going to write on here, “Dallas,
Texas, Detective T. D. McMillon, 3-27-64, Exhibit 5016.” Now, let me see if
we can get a place where you can—let me clear this off. Now, would you take
this and take that pencil and would you mark on there where you were standing
when you took up what you call your position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. These are the swinging doors that we come out of, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Right along in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Would you write out in here, put an arrow or something
and put your name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. The full name or just the initials?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Just something. The “T. D.” That is all right. Now, would
you put down where Miller was standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Right along in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You want to do something to mark that that is Miller?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay; was there anybody on your left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I believe it was Detective Watson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Right along in here somewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How is it that you—you seem to have a better recollection of
Miller than Watson, is that correct?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. There was some more people down this line. I believe I
talked to Miller—I don’t know what we talked about—just prior to the shooting.
I know that Watson was along there and “Blackie” Harrison, was along over
this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This is the position, say, 10 minutes before Oswald was brought
down, is that right, 5 or 10 minutes before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Did you see Rio Pierce or Sam Pierce’s car pull
out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you see anybody get out of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes; seemed to me like a sergeant got out of that car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see anybody attempt to clear away the crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I believe that is what this sergeant was doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, as you looked over there at the car, how many lines deep,
if there was more than one line, were the news people across the Main Street
ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t know. Those people were right along in this area
along in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you are indicating the area behind the <span class="locked">railing——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or just in front of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Part of them were behind this railing and some of them were
over in here and along in here like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So most of the news people were strung out along the railing
extending toward the armored car, is that right, or toward the Commerce Street
ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. It seemed to me like that most of them was in an area
something similar to this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. You want to put some sort of a mark where they
were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. It seemed to me like they were in there. Of course, there
were some along in here. Of course, they weren’t orderly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As they never are. Would you write in there “News Media”
or something to that effect? Okay. That has been marked “Press.” Now,
can you describe how thickly the people were congregated from the west wall
of the Main Street ramp across?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. This is the west wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, sir; how thickly were they congregated across to the
railing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t know, but there were some officers lined up across this
way to some point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember where any of those officers were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes; I think “Blackie” Harrison was along in here. I don’t
remember who else was along in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you put a mark where Harrison was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Seems to me like he was along in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you put his name where Harrison was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. What did you say his initials are?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. W. J.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. W. J.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you put an “X” there where you think Harrison was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes. He was along in here. He was on out past this deal,
past this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see him there, oh, 5 minutes before Oswald was brought
down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t recall. I am sure that he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have any recollection as to whether or not he took up
a position and generally held it in the same spot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I am sure that he did because we had the line. It seemed
to me like it was a pretty orderly line of officers, in other words, seemed to be
pretty straight, in other words, this flank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh. Now, when Rio Pierce’s car went up the ramp, what
did you see happen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Well, they had the red lights on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how far did you see him go up the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Well, I couldn’t see very far. I could see him right here just
starting up the deal, swinging up this way and starting up this way. I can
see him go up the ramp, but standing here, you can’t see up very far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you move out at all to see the car go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No. I may have done like that to see who it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Looked around the corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. But you can’t see from there up the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Now, between the time that Pierce’s car went out and
Oswald was brought down, where did you look, what were you looking at?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I was looking straight ahead, and I think I heard somebody
say, “Here he comes,” and naturally you become a little bit more attentive or
a little bit more rigid, I will say, but they hadn’t left very long before they
started bringing Oswald out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, is it your understanding that you believed that the three
men, who you have marked here, Miller, you <span class="locked">and——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Watson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Watson were supposed, as Oswald got to them, to move out sort
of on the flank and move with them to the armored car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes, just like, the way I had done, you know, just kind of
make, say, a left face and the ones on that side were doing the same thing, and
he would be walking between us. <span class="locked">That——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. That was my understanding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you remember anybody specifically telling you this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Captain Jones told us, you know, to form two lines on both
sides of him, form the barrier. The exact wording, I don’t know, but form
the barrier until they got the man in the car, and keep those people away from
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you see anybody come down into the basement at any
time while you were down there and ask if everything was all ready?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Come down that ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No, no. Did anyone come down into the basement area to determine
if things were set up properly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Well, the fact of what I know, the man that I heard came
right by me. I don’t know if he was speaking directly to me or not, but I
answered, “Yes, sir,” something to that effect. Still don’t know if he was
speaking directly to me or not, but it was Captain Fritz coming out of the jail
office followed by Leavelle, Graves, and Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When Captain Fritz spoke in your direction, that was the first
time, was it, that anybody that you can recall inquired as to whether things
were all set up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when Fritz—when Oswald emerged from that door, what
did Watson do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. When Oswald came out of the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Well, I was standing kind of like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are <span class="locked">standing——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Fritz comes right on by me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are standing with your back to the wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Right. They come out of the deal, right by me. Captain
Fritz, he had gone on by. Leavelle, he had gotten over to me. I glanced over
here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You glanced to your right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes. They had gotten slightly past me. I started pulling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
out of my part of the barrier when they had gotten past. L. D. Montgomery,
detective in Homicide, was following Oswald and the two detectives.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you remember why it was that you waited until Oswald
got ahead of you until you moved out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I imagine that it was because there was still some people
who I recognized as part of his escort from the homicide bureau. Montgomery,
say for instance, he was guarding the rear of Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, was it your understanding that you were supposed to be
alongside of Oswald or were you supposed to wait until Oswald got past you?
Did you have any understanding?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. My understanding was that, as they came on out and got by
us, we would form the two lines and keep the two lines intact until he was
placed in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it your <span class="locked">understanding——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Of course, I had to look to see if all of the procession was
through coming out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it your understanding that this line that was forming on
the side of Oswald, was it your understanding that there was supposed to be
somebody up ahead of Oswald as well as behind him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I didn’t know who from homicide would be with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You people, who were on the side, you flankers, so to speak,
were there any of you flankers supposed to be in front?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there any specific instructions that you were supposed
to be in front or behind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there anybody that was supposed to be the leader in this,
that was supposed to turn and you were supposed to follow him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I think maybe we can go most easily from here if I break in
a second. I am going to hand you a series of documents <span class="locked">and——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And I am going to ask you to just go out into the hall and read
them.</p>

<p>(Recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to mark for the purposes of identification as Exhibit
5017 a document, which is a copy of a report of an interview held by FBI Agents
Allen H. Smith and Tom E. Chapoton [spelling] C-h-a-p-o-t-o-n, with you, Officer
McMillon, on December 4, 1963. Have you had a chance to read this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes, I read it out in the hall a while ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, is there—are there any corrections or additions that you
would like to make in that interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Would you then sign on the page there that I have
marked the exhibit and date it, sign any place that it is convenient?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Today is the 25th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, sir. Okay. Now, I am going to mark for the purposes of
identification a letter dated November 27, 1963, from you to Chief Curry—this
is a copy of a typewritten letter—and mark that, “Exhibit 5018, Dallas, Texas,
Detective McMillon, 3-25-64.” Have you had a chance to read that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And is that a true and accurate copy of a letter which you sent
to Chief Curry on that date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I have corrected this letter. It was written on the 24th.
It was typed, apparently, on the 27th. I don’t recall that date. I am sure that
is right, but it was written on the 24th, and at a departmental interview, I gave
a statement correcting two or three points in this deal. Here where it says
I recognized Detective Leavelle on the prisoner’s <span class="locked">left——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I believe that is incorrect. He was on the prisoner’s right,
his left hand, in other words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You want to draw a line? I will draw a line here through the
word “left.” I will draw a line out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I will draw a line out to the corner. Would you put in “right,”
and then would you indicate in parentheses, would you indicate in parentheses
that this was corrected in a later interview with whomever it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If you would, put it out in the margin right after. <span class="locked">Now——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Just one second.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Okay. Now, this is correct. This is the way that I wrote
it on that date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, let me ask you a few questions, Detective McMillon, about
this letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you first learn that you were going to have—going
to be asked to write a letter like this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. It was between 3:30 and 4 o’clock, Captain Nichols, my bureau
commander, instructed everybody from the automobile theft bureau, who was
on duty in the basement at the time, to write the special report, and that is
when I wrote this, which is this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. You have here what appears to be a <span class="locked">copy——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. This is typed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Of a handwritten? Now, would you indicate, then, on this
typed copy, which we have, where the date is, would you cross—was the actual
copy of the letter dated November 27?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I wrote it on the, 24th, and apparently this is when the girl
typed it, on the 27th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you circle that date, “27th,” and indicate on there that
it was actually written by hand on the 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Detective McMillon, you have been good enough to bring here
with you a copy of this original handwritten letter. Can the commission have
this copy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Not that one, but I am sure that it will be available to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If we made a copy of this, had this copied and gave it back to
you, could we then retain it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No. I would rather you get that from the department.
That is Captain Nichols’, a copy that he had in his office, but I am sure he will
give it to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. You don’t even want to let us copy it without getting his
permission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Will you call him before you leave here and ask him
if we can copy this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Sure. You can call him right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No. Let’s get on with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I want any permission to come from them. I don’t want the
responsibility of giving out departmental stuff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I understand. You say that Captain Nichols told you to prepare
a report of what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. He instructed everybody to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, have you—has any information come into your possession
or did you know at the time whether Captain Nichols was acting on his own or
whether other department heads had been instructed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I didn’t know at the time when he instructed us if that was his
own or if he had been instructed to have us do same.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, is Captain Nichols the head of the auto theft bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes, he is.</p>

<p>(Discussion off of the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That was Assistant Chief Batchelor, and I asked him if I could
have permission to copy it, and he said “Okay.” Is that good enough for you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me do this right now. Let me take the copy of it and give
it to one of our girls and ask her to take it and get a copy of it. Excuse me.
Do you know, Detective McMillon, if people in any of the other bureaus were
asked to make reports on the 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t know. I am sure some of them were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh. Now, let me mark for identification a document which
purports to be the report of an interview conducted with you by Special Agents
George W. H. Carlson and Paul H. Scott of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
I will mark this, “Dallas, Texas, Detective McMillon, 3-25-64,” and this will be
Exhibit 5019. Have you had a chance, to read over what is marked Exhibit 5019?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes, I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And do you have any additions or corrections you want to make
in that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Would you take these three exhibits? You have
signed the first one. Would you sign and date Exhibit 5018 and Exhibit 5019?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Where do you want them signed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Any appropriate place where you have got space.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. The reason I am looking through this—one second.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. See, there are two FBI reports, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. And then the copy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Of your report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes. You are missing one copy, one other statement that
I made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am? Now, can you get a copy of that for us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t know if I can or not. The department has it. I am
sure it is available to us, because they had it during the trial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. It is in this statement that I corrected this other stuff here
in my original report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It would be easier for us if you would go back to whoever has
custody of those, whoever has the responsibility for it, and then ask if you
can get a copy of it and ask if you can send it to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am sure that you won’t have any difficulty getting it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t think so. I thought probably you would have it
attached to it. I am sure they probably still have that typed in court. It is
a typewritten report that I made to two lieutenants, department. The third was
wrote out; the second one was the two FBI agents; the third one was the one
you are missing; the fourth one is this FBI report that you have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to move away from the reports, go back to what happened
on the 24th. As I understand it from the reports that I have marked here
for identification, you remained with Ruby from the time that he was brought
into the jail office until about 3:30 in the afternoon. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I was with Ruby from the time that I first grabbed an arm
out there and the scuffle followed; I was with him from that point until about
3:30 in the afternoon, and during this time that I was with him on the fifth
floor until 3:30 in the afternoon, I was away at different times for short
intervals.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you got Ruby up to the fifth floor, was he dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did there come a time when you searched him thoroughly
and undressed him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you present during that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. During part of that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall who else was present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Detective Archer, Detective Clardy, some of the jail personnel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, were you present when his pockets were emptied out?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I believe that I was. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall whether or not he had a wallet on him at that
time or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t recall definitely, but I don’t believe that he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Try to think as best you can, now. What was—what do you
remember being taken off of his person at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I know that there was some money. You mean in addition
to the clothing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I know that he had some money on him; I know that he had
two post card deals on him, in his property at the jail, that had these “Impeach
Earl Warren” deals on them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Two post cards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Two pieces of paper. The best I remember, they were pieces
of paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could they have been photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk to him or did you hear anybody talk to him
about these photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. It came out later on in the conversation up in the jail, I
believe that he had gone out and photographed them, I believe, but anyway
he mentioned this Bernard Weissman, something that he had read about a
derogatory article that he had read in the paper, he had tried to run that down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, let me ask you this. Were you present when Agent Hall
of the FBI interviewed him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes, part of the time. I was in and out for some short
intervals. Phone calls, we will say, rest room, away for things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. Now, I don’t want you to tell me about anything that
happened right this moment while Hall was conducting the interview. Now,
were you also present when <span class="locked">Sorrels——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. When he first came up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I don’t want you to tell me anything right at this point
about what was said when Sorrels was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you there all of the time that agent—not agent but
Sergeant Dean was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No. I was away during one of those intervals. I was there
part of the time. I was there when Sorrels brought Dean up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you there when Dean left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I am sure I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you there when Sorrels left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes, I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Between the time that Sorrels left and the time Dean left,
did you leave at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes. I was away during the time that Sorrels and Dean
were there with him. I had gone around to attend to some other little detail.
I didn’t hear what it was. I didn’t hear all of their conversation. I heard
part of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Dean and Sorrels leave together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t know whether they did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don’t want you to tell me anything that was said when Dean
was there or when Sorrels was there. Now, with reference to these pictures
and the Bernard Weissman statement, was that made—did you hear him talk
about that at any time when Hall, Dean or Sorrels were not there? In other
words, when was it that you heard them talked about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t know at what point during the day that it was. There
was so much conversation, I don’t remember at what point during the day that
that was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. When his pockets were emptied, did people immediately
begin to question him about these items that were found in his pockets?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. We didn’t attempt to question the man or to interrogate him
at all; it was more in the line of conversation. What Clardy or Archer or I had
to say to him, it wasn’t in the form of interrogation, it was in the form of conversation.
We knew that it wasn’t our business or place to try to. We felt we
were there strictly for security.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you three, Archer, Clardy, and you, were you the ones
that stripped his clothes and took the property out of his pockets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. We assisted in it. There was some jailers assisting us, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you removed the contents of his pockets, what did
you do with that material?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. As best I remember, we gave it to a jailer. I recall that a hat
was sent up to the jail. I had lost mine during the scuffle. A hat was sent up
to the jail. They thought it was mine. I recall seeing some of that property
placed in his hat, but I can’t remember for sure. I know it was turned over to
authorized jail personnel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It was turned over to some jailer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, is that the normal procedure, when a man is stripped, to
turn it over to a jailer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. His property?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, whose responsibility was it to fill out an inventory at that
point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. It would have been the jailer’s, and it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you didn’t fill out an inventory on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember if any keys were taken out of his pocket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you examine those keys?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Not at this particular point. I can explain that right now, if
you want me to go into it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, I would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Okay. Later in the afternoon, one of the lieutenants, I believe
it was, instructed me to take the keys from his property, to meet, I believe, Lieutenant
Smart and Lieutenant Swain with those keys so they could get into his
car. I took those keys and went to where they had told me that I would find
them. I believe it was on the parking lot in front of the Western Union. I
walked down there, and I couldn’t find them. I returned to the jail, and I
was later able to determine that they had already gotten the car and had
impounded it and had taken care of that, so the keys weren’t needed, so I took
the keys back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The keys that you had, was it clear to you that this key chain
had a car key on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes, I believe so. I am not sure, but I mean I am sure that
it was, whether I took it for granted or what, but I assumed that there was a
key on it that fit the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk with Ruby about whether there was a key on it
that fit the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t recall. Possibly may have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any information at the time you got a hold of
these keys as to whether the car was locked or unlocked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t remember that. It had come up in the conversation
some way that he had a dog in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, how did that come up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t remember that, but maybe Jack asked us to take care
of his dog or something like that. I don’t know. I made no note of it after
I had found that they had impounded the car, that that matter had been taken
care of, and I felt like that ended our responsibility or it was someone else’s
responsibility, other than the three of us remaining there as security there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, during the time that Dean and Sorrels were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
present, was at least one of the other three of you, Archer, Clardy, and you,
present with Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes, I believe so, probably most of the time and probably it
would have been Archer more, because I was running about the jail taking care
of some of the details. I was away for short periods of time, so I didn’t hear
all of the conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you—by the time Dean and Sorrels left, what information
did you have as to how Ruby had gotten into the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. They had already come out by then and had just walked
right straight down the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did that come to your attention?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Let me see. Let me see those notes there. I believe I have
it in them. Refresh <span class="locked">my——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is a statement that you made on December 4?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. That is the second.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why don’t you look at your statement of the 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. We are still missing that fourth report. I believe it was
covered in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, now, that is a later report, but on the date of the 24th,
when these things were fresh in your mind at 3:30, you didn’t mention anything
in your report, did you, about how Ruby got down the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Just a second. No, sir; I didn’t mention it then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Well, I couldn’t possibly have mentioned everything that I
knew about the deal here. I just didn’t mention it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you knew that was important, didn’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No, sir; I didn’t think anything about it being important at
all at the time. I gave that information, I believe—this report was written on
Sunday—I gave it to them on Saturday, I believe, during the departmental
investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In the meantime, had you talked with Dean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. With Dean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t recall if I had or not. I don’t remember whether I
had seen him or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In the meantime, had you talked with Archer or Clardy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Oh, yes; sure had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There came a time, didn’t there, when Dean was under a lot of
pressure from the people in the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t know anything about that. Probably no more than the
rest of us. I don’t know. I think that Dean got misquoted or something in
the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And the department conducted—directed particular attention to
that in part of their investigation, didn’t they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t know that that was what the investigation was over or
not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Didn’t you know somewhere along the line that Dean might
possibly be in trouble?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No, sir; this article in the paper, I had heard all different
kinds of rumors. I had heard that the officer, who was supposed to be the one
that saw him milling around outside, was an ex-police officer, the article in the
paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There was an article in the paper that particularly quoted Dean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I haven’t seen the article. I understand that there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is right. Now, were you present when Agent Hall questioned
Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Part of the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you there when Agent Hall questioned Ruby about how he
got down the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I may or may not have been. I don’t know. It seemed to me
like most of his conversation I recall Hall asking him there, I am sure I already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
knew or had been told, but it seemed to me like Hall was running a background
information, background check. His questioning seemed to be along that line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall Hall asking Ruby how he got down the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or how Ruby got in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t recall Hall asking him that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me say this. If you had heard this and Ruby gave information
to Hall that you say was different from what you say you heard Dean get out
of Ruby, you would have brought that to Hall’s attention, wouldn’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I probably would have, had I heard it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If you had heard him say something different, you would have
brought it to his attention?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I am sure that I would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In fact, any police officer would have done that, don’t you think
so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes; I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, isn’t it true that, as late as—well, strike this—did you sign
the typed copy, the original typed copy of Exhibit 5018?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Did I sign it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So you saw that original typed copy after it had been typed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, on November 27 <span class="locked">or——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Let’s back up just a second. You said did I sign the original
typed copy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I am sure that I did. I thought you were referring to the
original handwritten, the one that I had written out in hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I am pretty sure that I signed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It indicates that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you read it over before you signed it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Oh, sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the time that you signed that report, did you know that
there was an investigation being conducted in the police department as to how
Ruby got into the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Sure did. I had already been interviewed by the FBI when
I signed this departmental report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, if—and did you feel that the information, which you say
that you got, that you heard Ruby give Dean, did you feel on November 27 that
that was important information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. What was that again, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I believe you stated before that you heard Ruby tell Dean that
he came down the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes, I heard Jack say that he came down the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, at the time that you signed this report on
November the 27th, did you realize that such a statement from Ruby was a
matter of concern to the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. At the time that I signed those reports was just like all of
the rest of them. I realized that anything that I might know or that I can
remember might be of some value or of some significance to anybody who was
investigating it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You certainly knew that any statement that Ruby made about
how he got down into that basement would be something that somebody might
want to know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You read that report over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And there is nothing in that report about Ruby having made
such a statement, is there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. This first one here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Let’s see. I don’t believe so. No, sir; I don’t see anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, you have had a chance to look over Exhibit
5019, haven’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes, I have looked it over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you tell the Secret Service agents, who interviewed
you at that time, about the <span class="locked">statement——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I was never interviewed by anybody who was identified as
Secret Service agents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am sorry. FBI agents. Did you tell those FBI agents anything
about Ruby’s statement to Dean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I told them about how he said he got into the basement. I
don’t believe they asked me about Dean, that Ruby told him down the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time did this interview take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Let’s see the date on this. This is the two agents that came
to see me on the 25th, that is on Monday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; do you remember what time of the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes; in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In the afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you talked to Dean between the time he left you and that
afternoon, the time you made that statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t recall that I had, but I don’t believe that I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know by the time you made this statement that Dean
had reported to somebody in the police department that he saw the man come
down <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. No; I didn’t know that at that time. I didn’t know that
Dean had allegedly said anything of that stuff then. People had told me, after
I had got off duty, this, that and the other. I heard somewhere that Dean had
been on an interview somewhere on television or something, and that is as much
as I knew. I don’t know. I don’t believe that this article was out at the
time. It possibly may have been. I think this article came out a week or two
later where Dean is supposed to have said that he seen him. I believe it was
some time later after this, a week or so later after this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk with either Archer or Clardy or anybody else in
the police department about this statement that Ruby made to you between the
time that Ruby made it and the time you gave that interview with the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t recall what the conversation was. Archer, Clardy,
and several more of us discussed the case, but Captain Nichols, about the time
we got in from the jail about 3:30, when we started writing that report over
<span class="locked">there——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Captain Nichols’ instructions were for each of us to write
what we had been doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. What we had been doing, facts about it, instructed us not to
talk to any other man about it, that he wanted each man’s own report, which
I wrote my own report. After I had written my report and turned it in, there
has been a lot of conversation about it. I have discussed it with numerous
people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did anybody from the homicide bureau question you about the
statement that Ruby made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. May have been, but I don’t remember when. Something about
I was supposed to sign an affidavit to them or something, but I don’t believe I
ever signed any affidavit to them, some fact that I <span class="locked">was——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How soon after you heard this statement from Ruby were you
questioned by homicide detectives concerning that statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. I don’t think I was ever to the point where we could say
questioned by them. It seems to me like one of them asked me in the hall, “Did
you hear him say so and so, did you hear this, that and the other, could you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
testify to this, that and the other, did you hear it?” It came up in a couple
of days, but, as far as I know, I didn’t sign an affidavit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you testify at the trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you testify about having heard this statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. How he entered the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Okay. I believe you are going to be a little more briefed
on it when you get the fourth report. It is covered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. There is four reports, he only has three, but anyway that is
the statement that I made at this departmental investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me hand you an exhibit marked 5015. That is something
you prepared, diagram, Commerce, Main, Pearl, and Expressway. Would you
sign that and date it? Let me hand you what has been marked as Exhibit
5020, which is a copy of a copy, which you provided us of your original handwritten
statement of November 24 to Chief Curry. Would you look that over so
you are certain that that is a true and accurate copy and then, if you feel it is
true and accurate, would you sign it and date it? Would you prefer to do that
out in the hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. It won’t be but just a minute here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McMillon</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Listen, Tom. I appreciate your coming up here.</p>

<h2 id="SORRELS">TESTIMONY OF FORREST V. SORRELS</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of Forrest V. Sorrels was taken at 1 p.m., on May 6, 1964, at 200
Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C., by Messrs. Burt W. Griffin, Leon D.
Hubert, Jr., and Samuel A. Stern, assistant counsel of the President’s Commission.
Fred B. Smith, Deputy General Counsel, U.S. Treasury Department was
present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Sorrels, my name is Leon Hubert. I will be taking your
deposition this afternoon, and so will Mr. Samuel Stern. We are both members
of the advisory staff of the General Counsel of the President’s Commission,
that is to say Mr. Rankin.</p>

<p>Under the provisions of Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963,
the Joint Resolution of Congress, No. 137, and rules of procedure adopted by
the Commission in conformance with that Executive order and that joint resolution,
both Mr. Stern and I have been authorized to take a sworn deposition
from you, Mr. Sorrels. Of course you will take an oath a little later on. Is it
understood between us that this statement of my authority and of Mr. Stern’s
authority is sufficient to carry for both depositions—in other words, it will be
really a continuation of the deposition by Mr. Stern on another area. Is that
understood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it understood also that the oath you are going to take will be
applicable to the testimony elicited from you by me, as well as that elicited
from you by Mr. Stern?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I state to you now that the general nature of the Commission’s
inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate and report upon the facts relating to the assassination
of President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey
Oswald. In particular as to you, Mr. Sorrels, the nature of the inquiry today
is to determine what facts you know about the death of Oswald and other pertinent
facts which you may know about the general inquiry.</p>

<p>Mr. Sorrels, you have appeared today by virtue of a verbal request made by us
at the direction of the General Counsel. Under the rules adopted by the Commission,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
all witnesses are entitled to a 3-day written notice prior to the taking
of their deposition. But the rules also provide that a witness may waive this
notice. I ask you now if you are willing to waive the 3-day written notice
provided for by the rules of the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Then I will ask you to stand and be sworn. Do you
solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give in this matter will be
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you state your full name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Forrest V. Sorrels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old are you, Mr. Sorrels?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Sixty-three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you reside now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. 3319 Hanover, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Special agent in charge of the Dallas district of the United
States Secret Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, before I go any further, I should like the record to show
that Mr. Fred B. <span class="locked">Smith——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Deputy General Counsel, United States Treasury Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is present—in what capacity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I guess observer on behalf of the Secretary of Treasury.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And Mr. Burt Griffin, also a member of the staff of the General
Counsel of the President’s Commission, is also present.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Sorrels, I would like for you to state to us the general background,
your history, sort of a biographical sketch, if you will, starting off with your
education and on to date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I was born in Red River County, Tex., on a farm, September 16,
1901; later moved to a little town nearby called Bogata, Tex. I lived there
until 1916, when my family moved to El Paso, Tex. I resided there until 1935.</p>

<p>I went to El Paso High School and after graduation attended Draughon’s
Business College, taking typing and shorthand and bookkeeping. I then went
to work for a small wholesale grocery, worked there for only a short time, and
then went to work for a brick company, worked there a very short time, and
then obtained employment as a clerk in the office of Bureau of Narcotics,
Treasury Department, in El Paso, Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What year was that, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That was in 1922. I worked there for about a year and went
back to the brick company. I was only there a short time when I learned
of a clerical position in the office of the United States Secret Service at El Paso.
I later was employed in that position on July 6, 1923. That was a two-man
office, and I began very shortly after employment there assisting and helping
in investigative work.</p>

<p>In 1926, the special agent in charge was transferred from there, and prior
to that time I had been appointed as what was known at that time as an
operative, which is comparable to our special agent of today. He transferred
from there to Dallas about July of 1926, and I was left as acting agent in charge
of that office. In October that “acting” was removed, and I continued there
in the capacity of agent in charge until 1935, when I was transferred to Dallas
as special agent in charge there. In 1936 I was transferred to New Orleans
as acting supervising agent of a newly created setup whereby the States of
Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi were in what was known at that time as the
Tenth District.</p>

<p>In 1938, the headquarters office was moved from New Orleans to Houston.
In 1941 it was moved from Houston to Dallas. Subsequent to that time, the
organization of the 15 supervising agents was abandoned, and each office
reported direct into the headquarters office in Washington, excepting a very
few that were known as resident agency officers.</p>

<p>I have continued in that capacity as special agent in charge of the Dallas
district, and am so employed at the present time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that you have been special agent in charge actually of the
Dallas district since 1938.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Actually—it was in my territory since 1935, but the office was
moved back there in 1941, and I have been there ever since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you have lived there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What does the Dallas territory now, under your jurisdiction, and
control, consist of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Roughly it consists of the northern half of Texas, exclusive of
the territory west of the Pecos River. We have in the Dallas district the
entire northern judicial district of Texas, the Waco division of the western
district of Texas, the Tyler, Jefferson, Texarkana, Parris, and Sherman divisions
of the eastern district of Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By divisions, you mean divisions in the United States court
system?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many men do you have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. At the present time we have six special agents besides myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They all work out of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir. One special agent actually headquarters, so to speak,
in Fort Worth. He remains in that section most of the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you tell us something about your family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I am married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I have a daughter 16 years of age and a younger daughter 7
years of age. I have 2 children by a former marriage, a son who is a captain
in the United States Army and a daughter who is married to an employee of
the IBM Company in New York City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been married to your present wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Since 1946.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Sorrels, Mr. Stern is going to take a deposition with respect
to security measures and other matters, I think, in regard to the President.
I am going to depose you with reference to a number of matters concerning
principally the security of Oswald after he was arrested and until his death,
and your activities with reference to Ruby after he had shot Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, getting into the first matter, can you tell us what you
observed yourself of the security measures which were in effect and actually
operating with reference to Oswald after his arrest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. The first time that I saw Oswald was on the afternoon of
November 22 as he was coming out of Capt. Will Fritz’ office in the Dallas Police
Department on the third floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what time was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. The exact time I cannot give you, because I had been working
at a frantic pace. It was some time probably past the middle of the afternoon.
I had previously been informed by my office that Captain Fritz had endeavored
to locate me because he had a suspect in custody. And when I arrived there,
Captain Fritz was in his office, apparently talking to the suspect, whom I determined
to be Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>As he was being removed from the office, I told Captain Fritz that I would
like to talk to this man when an opportunity was afforded, and he remarked
“You can talk to him right now—just go right around the corner there by the
side of the office,” which I did.</p>

<p>Oswald was brought around and was seated there. There were a number
of other officers present, detectives, I think possibly some FBI agents, and
maybe some of my agents had come in in the meantime.</p>

<p>I started <span class="locked">to——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Before you go into that, would you tell us about the security
measures that you observed with reference to protecting the person of Oswald
from the time you first saw him, say up until the time you have reached now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. As far as I know, there was no one except authorized officers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
in that particular area at that time. I did not see anyone that I recognized
to be other than an officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No news people in the corridor of the third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I am talking about inside the office now. In the corridor,
that was an entirely different situation because there were cameras set up,
tripods, still photographers, photographers with cameras in their hands, and
newspapermen in large numbers in the hallways.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, for example, when Captain Fritz afforded you an
opportunity to speak to Oswald and indicated that you could do so at a little
office around the corner, did that mean that you had to pass Oswald out of
Fritz’ office, and through this third floor corridor, where all the newsmen
were gathered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was still within Fritz’ office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir; in other words, there was an office there, and Captain
Fritz had an office built within that office—just merely to take him out of the
door and right around the corner of his inside office there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then you did interview Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I talked to him, started asking him questions, and he was
belligerent and arrogant in his attitude and he said to me, “I don’t know who
you fellows are, a bunch of cops.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you speak to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Not very long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In point of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Not over—I don’t think over 10 minutes at the most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what happened to him after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. As far as I know, he was taken back to the jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, taking him back to the jail would involve passing him
out of Fritz’ office, through the corridor, and to the jail elevator, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is correct; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us what security precautions you observed with
reference to his person after he was out of Fritz’ office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. They of course had him handcuffed when they removed him,
and several detectives accompanied him as they left out, in front—someone went
ahead. And as I recall it there was at least one on the side, and then some
brought up the rear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not go up to the jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you observe any system of identification of the people who
were on the third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. As I recall it, when I first went down there I had no particular
difficulty getting in, because most of the officers there know me, from my years
of being in that city. But subsequent to that time I would have to identify
myself many times. This was to uniformed police officers that were on duty.
And I would have to show my commission book in order to get into Captain
Fritz’ office, or else get into the executive offices there, where the chief of police
and the deputy chief offices were located.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you observe any officers posted at the entrances to the area,
to the third floor area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. By the elevator, and then there were uniformed officers at Captain
Fritz’ door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you observe them requiring identification by other persons?
I mean you described how they required you to identify yourself. Did you
notice whether they did so with other people, and if so, what did they do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I cannot say that I did, because usually when I get through
identifying myself, I either went to the executive suite, where the chief’s
office was, or right direct to Captain Fritz’ office. But on a number of occasions,
the officers that were on duty there, before I can get my commission
book out, some of the newsmen or photographers there that knew me would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
say, “He is Sorrels of the Secret Service.” I, upon being recognized and
identifying myself, would be admitted. Some of the officers on duty there of
course after the second or third time they would recognize me, and I would
have no difficulty getting in. But I cannot say that I saw anyone else being
required to identify themselves, because I did not hang around the places
where the officers were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you say that the security conditions that you just described
were in effect for the entire period of November 22 through November
24—that is, on the third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Captain Fritz’ office definitely yes—going into his office. I
do not recall having to identify myself to get onto the third floor on the 22d
when I first got down there. But subsequent to that time, I do recall having
to identify myself almost every time I went up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the general condition of the third floor area from
point of personnel, equipment, and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I guess you could term it more or less deplorable, because of the
fact that they had so many cameras with tripods and cables and wires and
photographers and reporters that you would have to step over tripods and wires
and almost elbow your way to get in and out of the place. And every time
you would come out of it—Captain Fritz’ office—they would turn on those
bright lights, and you would have to shield your eyes almost to keep from
being temporarily blinded.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you mean—that last condition you described took place when
anybody came out of Fritz’ office, or when they came out with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No—I would not say just anybody, but many times when I
would start out, the minute they would see anyone coming out of the door,
they would turn the lights on, I guess to be prepared in case Oswald or anyone
else that they wished to photograph would come out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. During the period that we are talking about, that is, say, from
the arrest of Oswald the first time you saw him until the 24th, I take it that you
observed Oswald being moved from Captain Fritz’ office to the jail elevator
at least quite a number of times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I can only recall two times, I believe. The first time is when
he was taken out of Captain Fritz’ office on the afternoon of the 22d. Then
there were two other occasions I knew of when he was brought back into
Captain Fritz’ office and when he was taken out. I remember that many times.
In other words, about three going out and two coming in I can definitely recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, do you recall that while he was being so moved on any
one of those occasions, that he was addressed by the press or questions asked
him, or remarks made to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, because the time that I saw him he was in Captain Fritz’
office or being removed from his office. I never saw him in the hallway that
I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I thought you had mentioned a little while ago that on
the first occasion you did observe him—after you had interviewed him for
about 10 minutes—you did observe him move out of Fritz’ office and go to the
elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I think your question, as I understand it, sir, was that he was
removed from Captain Fritz’ office to the elevator. I did not see him taken
down the hallway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see; I did misunderstand you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you do not know really whether or not any news media or
any other people asked him questions and made remarks to him while he
was going from Fritz’ office to the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Not of my personal knowledge; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could those news people see into Fritz’ office from the hallway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. They could see into the outer office, but they could not very
well see into his office unless they actually came inside the office within which
his office is located. You have got one door that faces on the west side of the
office, and then Captain Fritz’ there faces north. So that it would be a question
of someone might see just a corner portion of his office from the hallway door,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
which is glass at the top, but they would not be able to see anyone sitting, for
example, where Oswald would have been sitting at the time that I saw him
in Captain Fritz’ office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, there was a glass door to what might be called
the outer office of Captain Fritz’ office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But the inner office, while it had a glass door, it did not face
on an area in which the press was located.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That’s right. It also had Venetian-type blinds on the doors,
and the other part of his office was glass from the upper part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. While you were up there at any time during the period we
are talking about, did you ever observe anyone known to you to be a civilian
who was not either a police officer or connected with the news media in some
way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I do not; well, I will take that back. You are talking
about when Oswald was around?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, yes. But also I want to broaden it to any time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. The reason I asked that question is that Jack Ruby’s sister
was in his office with another lady after Ruby was in custody, and at that
time they were in there with Mr. Jim Underwood from radio station KRLD
who was trying to make arrangements for Ruby’s sister to get up in the jail
to see him. But prior to that, I do not know, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, were you present at a meeting at which the news media
were present and Oswald was brought into an assembly room, in which the
news media were assembled?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I was present when Oswald was brought into what is called
the lineup room, which is also the assembly room. They have the lineup section
at one end of it. That was on the evening of November 22. At that time
it was my request, because a witness who had been interviewed by me, and
who had seen the person fire the third shot from the window of the Book
Depository Building, I had gotten in touch with him through one of our agents,
and he was brought down there for the specific purpose of being able to see
Oswald, because when he was first interviewed by me he stated that he thought
he could identify him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was in fact, however, a true lineup for the purpose of
identification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I am sorry—I did not understand the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I said that was a true lineup for the purpose of identification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I was speaking of another meeting where the assembly room
usually used for the lineup was used to give the press an opportunity to see
Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I was not present. That is the only time I saw Oswald in the
lineup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you aware at any time on the 22d of the concern expressed
by Mr. J. Edgar Hoover in regard to the security of Oswald, and allegedly
transmitted to the Dallas people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you become aware of that later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I do not recall ever having heard anything to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Even now you do not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know Jack Ruby at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Not before this incident took place; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not even know he existed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir. As a matter of fact, when I first heard Oswald had
been shot, I understood the name to be Jack Rubin, and in my first report to
my headquarters office I gave them the name of Jack Rubin—R-u-b-i-n, an
operator of a nightclub. That is the first information I got. I just misunderstood
the pronunciation of the last word.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think I have already asked this question in a general way—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>that
is to say, you have covered the area in a general way. But I think for
the record I should make it more specific.</p>

<p>You have now come to know a man by the name of Jack Ruby, to the extent
that you could recognize him, I suppose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us whether you saw him in or about the police
department building at any time after the President was shot, and until Ruby
shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I have no recollection of having seen a man whom I know now
to be Jack Ruby before I saw him in the Dallas City Jail on the fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, we can pass, I think, for my purposes—and mind you,
Mr. Stern might cover some of these areas again, but this is the way this is
being handled.</p>

<p>You did see Oswald, I think, on Sunday morning, November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you tell us where and at what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That was in the office of Capt. Will Fritz of the homicide division
of the Dallas Police Department. It was somewhere around 11 o’clock
in the morning, and he was removed from Captain Fritz’ office at approximately
I guess about 11:15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the purpose of your interviewing him that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. We, of course, were interested in any statement that Oswald
might make relating to any phase of the assassination of the President. Particularly,
I was interested in trying to obtain an admission from him that he
had used the name of A. Hidell as an alias, because information had been
developed that he had purchased the rifle which was found on the sixth floor
of the Book Depository under the name of A. Hidell.</p>

<p>There was a change of address card which he had filed in New Orleans,
as I recall it, on which it was shown that persons to receive mail at the address
given, the name of A. Hidell appeared. And after Captain Fritz got through
questioning him on the morning of November 24, he asked if any of the officers
present in the room desired to ask him any questions. And I said, “Yes; I
would like to ask him a question.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, Chief of Police Jesse Curry had come to Captain Fritz’
office, and inquired about the delay in moving him out. And Captain Fritz informed
that he was still talking to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Captain Fritz <span class="locked">informed——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Informed Chief <span class="locked">Curry——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That he was or you were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That he was. And a very short time after that is when I had
an opportunity to ask Oswald some questions. I showed Oswald the change
of address <span class="locked">card——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me ask you this: Was your interrogation of him cut off, as
it were, by the transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. By the transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you finished with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I had <span class="locked">finished——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As to that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. As to that point; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As a matter of fact, you would have had access to him, I think,
at the county jail, anyhow, would you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I had certainly planned on having access to him, and I am
sure I would have. As a matter of fact, I had in my mind to start talking
to him that afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I wanted to clarify is whether or not your effort to interrogate
him was interrupted. But I gather that it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, I would say not. Possibly, had he remained there, I
might have attempted to ask him more questions. But he was not giving out
much information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, during the whole time that Oswald was in custody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
of the Dallas Police Department, did you find that any obstacles or hindrances
were put in your way of examining him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir; except had he been in our own custody, there would
have been a chance to have questioned him without others being present, or
so many others being present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At the time that you were in Fritz’ office, on November 24, did
you hear any plans discussed for the transfer of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I did not say that I heard anything about any plans. I
do recall that Oswald requested to have some of his clothes brought down there,
because his shirt that he had on when he was arrested had been taken from
him, I think, for laboratory examination. And Captain Fritz sent and got
some of his clothes, and he selected kind of a sweater-type——</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you did not hear the officers of the Dallas police force
discussing the method of transportation and the security measures that they
had planned and put into operation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes; I did hear a part of it, I recall now. There was some
suggestion about transporting him in an armored car. Captain Fritz objected
to that because of—one reason that I recall was what effect it might
have in his trial, that that might prejudice the prosecution by him being transported
in an armored car, which is not of course ordinarily used in the transportation
of prisoners in that area.</p>

<p>Another thing that I recall is that Captain Fritz thought that the armored
car would be a bit cumbersome and it would not be able to maneuver as easily
as a car. And it was his desire to take him in a police car with escorts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear anyone suggest that the plan then proposed, and
ultimately carried out in part, at least, should be changed so as to bypass the
press, as it were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I did not. At that time there was no way to bypass
them, because they were out in the hall. As I had come to the building, I even
noticed cameras down in the basement of the city hall there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Could I interrupt just a second, sir. I may be completely wrong
about this, but wasn’t there something about the time of transporting him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes. As I understand it, some of the reporters had inquired
of Chief Jesse Curry as to whether or not he was going to transport him to
the county jail on the night of November 23.</p>

<p>Now, this is hearsay, that the reporters wanted to be relieved so they could
get some sleep if he was not going to be transported that night—they would
go home and get some rest.</p>

<p>Chief Curry himself told me that he had said something to this effect, “Go
on home and get your sleep, there won’t be anything doing before 10 o’clock
tomorrow morning.”</p>

<p>As I recall, I think the newspapers then published the fact that he would be
moved at 10 o’clock in the morning, or words to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I just wanted to get the full story, because I remembered him
having mentioned something about this. I do not know whether it is important.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, in that connection, had you heard that the FBI had received
an anonymous phone call from someone advising that an effort, by a
group of men, would be made to kill Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I do not recall that I had heard any such report at that time.
I did hear that there had been an anonymous call come into the police department
that someone would try to kill him when they removed him, or
words to that effect. But that, I believe, was subsequent to the time he was
actually shot. I do not recall that morning of having heard anything about
that. And I definitely did not hear anything about a group. I remembered
something about it later on, but I never heard anything about it at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear of any plans made as to the actual route that
would be followed in transporting Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Not before Oswald was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know why, from anything you knew then, or have
learned since, the cameramen and so forth were all congregated in the basement
area?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Would you read that question again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I am trying to get at is this: You testified a moment
ago that when you came in you saw all the press people with their cameras
and so forth in the basement area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Not all of them. I said I saw some down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which would indicate that they either had guessed or had somehow
become aware that—that would indicate that they either had guessed or
had somehow become aware that that would be a point on the route to be taken
at which they could get pictures. And I was wondering if you had heard anything
prior to that time about the route, or had you heard that these people
had been informed of the route?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; nothing about the route. The basement is used by the police
generally. They have a passageway which comes from Main Street down into
the basement, and then the exit continues on out to Commerce Street, and the
police cars that bring prisoners in use the basement. In other words, they drive
the car right down to the basement, and the actual receiving office, the receiving
office for the jail is on the basement floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall ever having spoken to either Curry or some other
member of the police department about the possibility of moving Oswald in a
way other than that which was planned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. When I heard that they were supposed to take him out at 10
o’clock—that was the announcement and so forth on the radio and in the papers—I
remarked to Captain Fritz that if I were he, I would not remove Oswald from
the city hall or city jail to the county jail at an announced time; that I would
take him out at 3 or 4 o’clock in the morning when there was no one around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know when you told that to Fritz?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That was on the Sunday morning, before he was removed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell that to any other person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was any other person present when you told that to Fritz?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What caused you to give that advice to Captain Fritz?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. The importance of the prisoner, to my mind, was such that in
order to remove the opportunity for some crackpot or anyone who might feel
inclined to try to kill the prisoner, if the removal was made more or less unannounced
or in secret, that those opportunities would have been at least lessened
to a great degree.</p>

<p>Captain Fritz said that Chief Curry did not want to—let’s reverse that just
a bit—that Chief Curry wanted to go along with the press and not try to put
anything over on them; or words to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you gather from what Fritz told you that the reason why
your suggestion was not acceptable was that Fritz at least thought that captain—that
Chief Curry did not want to break his word, as it were, to the press?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I didn’t consider it so much as breaking his word as I would
that he did not want to tell them one thing, or in other words, move him out
without the press being aware of the fact—let’s put it that way. That was my
impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time was it, about, do you know, that you made that
suggestion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That was pretty close to 11:15 in the morning, just a short time
before they got ready to move him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You do not know, do you, whether he conveyed your thought to
Chief Curry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I do not. I doubt that he did, because Chief Curry had left
Fritz’ office at that time, as I recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember about what time it was when the Oswald move
began from Fritz’ office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. It was shortly after 11:15 in the morning, as I recall it. In
other <span class="locked">words——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go down with the party carrying him down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir; I did not. Inspector Kelley and I went to the office of
Chief Batchelor, which is also on the third floor, and on the south side of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
building, on the Commerce Street side, and we were observing the people across
the street from the city hall, as apparently they had been moved over there by
officers on duty down below. And we just saw several people over there that
were apparently waiting for an opportunity to see them take the prisoner out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you arrived at Chief Batchelor’s office, at the point you
have just described, to wit, the windows looking out on Commerce Street, do
you know whether Oswald had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I don’t think so, because that was immediately—in other
words, when they took Oswald out, I went right on down to the chief’s office,
that is right on the same floor. And we were there for a few minutes before
we heard that he had been shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But the Oswald party left Fritz’ office before you and Mr. Kelley
did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I am rather positive that he was taken out before I left, yes;
because I remember about bringing the clothes in there, and Oswald selecting,
I think, a sweater or something like that. I actually have no independent
recollection of seeing him going through the door or anything like that. He
could have been there when we walked out. But it is my impression that he
was taken out and shortly thereafter Mr. Kelley and I went to Chief Batchelor’s
office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did that involve walking a distance on the same floor of about
how many feet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Oh, possibly a 100 feet, 110, something like that. Captain Fritz’
office is not at the entirely opposite end of the building, but Chief Batchelor’s
office is. You go into the executive area there, and you cut over to the left-hand
corner, and Chief Batchelor’s office is in the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you first learn that Ruby had shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. One of the police officers that was on duty in the executive area
there told us that Oswald had been shot in the basement—in the stomach, as I
recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were still in Batchelor’s office at the time you were told that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I think we were right outside the office, in the area there. I do
not believe we were actually in his office at that particular time. I think we had
stepped outside there. And that I do not think was over, oh, I would say a
maximum of possibly 10 minutes, from the time we left Captain Fritz’ office to
go to Chief Batchelor’s office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Prior to the time that this policeman advised you that Oswald
had been shot, did you notice any commotion or anything to indicate something
wrong going on on Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you were standing at the window looking down, as I understand
it, on the scene on Commerce Street, waiting actually to see the
procession go out. But this officer told you this at the entrance to Batchelor’s
office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes. I was not at the window at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had moved away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. We had walked away from the window, I think, just killing time,
I guess. And we were actually in the—outside of Batchelor’s office, but in that
area there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I immediately rushed down to the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you go—by what route?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I grabbed an elevator, as I recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Public elevator or the jail elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; a public elevator—and got down to the basement floor, and
I headed right into the jailer’s office. And at that time Oswald was laying on
the floor and someone was giving him artificial respiration.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By mechanical means?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; by hand. I recall seeing his stomach was uncovered, his
shirt was pulled up like that, and the man apparently was over him giving him
artificial respiration by his hands.</p>

<p>I went to a telephone, which is in the jail office there, up against the wall, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
called my headquarters office and told Deputy Chief Paterni that Oswald had
been shot by a man named Jack Rubin—that is how I understood it at that
time—who operated a nightclub, and that was all the information I had at that
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Mr. Paterni was in Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was a long-distance call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what time the call was made, did you use a direct
line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I called it on the security phone, which we use in connection
with matters pertaining to the protection of prisoners. In other words, the
Signal <span class="locked">Corps—</span></p>

<p>(Witness provided telephone number.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you can use that on any telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that a security matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I beg your pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that a security matter, that telephone number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes—Signal Corps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think the record should show that the witness stated the number
that was called, but that we are not going to have it as a part of the record
because it is a security matter.</p>

<p>You, Mr. Reporter, will delete the number from the transcript.</p>

<p>What I was trying to get at is have you ascertained at what time that call
was made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would it be possible to do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I could not answer that question, because I do not know what
records are kept.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does it go as a long-distance call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. A long-distance call collect; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then the telephone company probably would have a record of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Possibly so. It is my understanding that at that time they were
not actually making any record of calls—they were coming in so fast, the employees
of the telephone company told me those calls—they put people through
and were not concerned about time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was this done by direct dialing or through the operator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Through the operator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it was a collect call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It would have to be charged to the government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. If it was recorded; yes, it would be, to that particular phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I wonder if you would be so kind as to undertake to ascertain
for us if there exists a record on that point, because, as you know, we are interested
in very narrow areas of time here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I would say this—that the time can be established within a
matter of a very few minutes, because Oswald was still on the floor and had not
been removed to the hospital at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>But you see, I have estimates of time from other people, and I want to see how
it conforms. And therefore, to tie it in, could you give us your estimate of how
many minutes or parts of minutes elapsed between the time you made your call,
you initiated it, and the time that Oswald actually moved out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That I cannot tell you, because I was not there when he was
moved out. I left then that area as soon as I made that call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was still in the area when you made the call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>The call went through very quickly. And I left that area then and went back
to Captain Fritz’ office, because I was interested in talking to the man who had
shot Oswald as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when you went down there to the jail office and saw Oswald,
as you testified, and made the call, was Jack Ruby there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I did not see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To your knowledge, he had already been removed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is correct; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, how did you get up to Fritz’ office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I went back up the elevator, the regular public elevator, and
went to his office and inquired of Captain Fritz, and I was informed that he
was not there, that he had gone to the hospital. I then asked him where was
Jack Rubin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, you had been informed at that time that the
last name of Jack Ruby was Rubin, R-u-b-i-n?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I still—as far as I knew, it was R-u-b-i-n, because that is the way
I gave it. I asked him where he was, and they said he was on the fifth floor.
And I said I would like to talk to him. <span class="locked">And——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who did you say that to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I do not recall who it was—some of the detectives down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In Fritz’ office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. In Captain Fritz’ office; yes. And Officer Dean was instructed
to take me up to where he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who instructed Dean to do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. The same officer I was talking to—I don’t remember who it
was, but someone <span class="locked">apparently——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know Dean prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I cannot say that I did. <span class="locked">So——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was Dean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That was in the detective office, Captain <span class="locked">Fritz——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was he doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I don’t know what he was doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case, the same officer to whom you made inquiry concerning
where Captain Fritz was and where Ruby was, that officer directed Dean,
who was in Fritz’ office, to take you up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>And we walked out then in the hallway to the jail elevator. Now, that is
a different one from the one I came to Fritz’ office in. And I was taken to the
fifth floor, and there I saw Ruby, whom I later found out to be Ruby, standing
there with, as I recall it, two uniformed police officers. And I introduced myself
to him, showed him my credentials, and told him that I would like to ask him
some questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, was this a cell, or what sort of a room was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. It wasn’t what you would call a cell, but the elevator—you had
to open up a door with bars on it to get into the area there. <span class="locked">And——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How large a room was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. It wasn’t very large, as I recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you give us something by way of dimensions in feet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I would say in width it was probably about, oh, 6 or 7 feet wide.
Now, as to length, I would not be able to say exactly how long it was, because
I was not interested in the size of the room or anything at that time, and I paid
no attention to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there tables and furniture and chairs in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nothing at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; nothing. He was standing there. He only had his shorts
on. His clothes had been removed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Dean go into that room with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that there were you and Dean and Ruby in the room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you mentioned there were two other officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. As I recall it, there were two uniformed police officers there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know who they were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, to get it clear—I do not mean if you knew who they were
at the time, but do you now know who they were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I do not know who they are now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And there were only those two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. There were possibly some other officers came in. I do not recall
that they were there at the time we got there, but there might have been
others came in. As I recall, there was somebody behind me. I wasn’t interested
in them. I was only interested in talking to this man as quickly as I could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Before we get into the details, can you tell us how long this
interview with Ruby lasted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I would say possibly not over 5 to 7 minutes, not very long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What brought it to an end?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I had gotten the information that I desired at that time, and was
anxious to get it back into Washington, because I had been asked to get as much
information as I could quickly, and get it back to them up there, something about
his background, who he was and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that during that interview, which lasted approximately 5 to
7 minutes, your thought is—you know that there was Dean and yourself and
Ruby, and you also know that there were two other officers whose names you do
not know even now, and you think that there might have been one or more
others who came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes—in plainclothes. I don’t recall any other uniformed officers
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you do not recall, I suppose, or do not know now the names of
any of those other people who might have come in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I could not tell you who they were at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I think you have made a report of that interview, and a
later one, and we will offer that in evidence a little later.</p>

<p>But I would like to ask you now if Ruby made any statement to your knowledge
at that time, and that is the first interview you had with him, concerning
whether he had been in the assembly room on the night of the 22d when Oswald
was brought in so that the press could observe him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Not at that time; no, sir. He did later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he at that time, the first interview, indicate anything, or say
anything which would indicate what his motive or reason for his act was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes; and I might say that it was at that time that I found out
his name was Ruby in place of Rubin, and he informed me his name had
formerly been Rubinstein, and that he had had his name changed in Dallas.</p>

<p>I asked him—after I identified myself, I told him I would like to ask him some
questions.</p>

<p>He said, “For newspapers or magazines?”</p>

<p>I said, “No; for myself.”</p>

<p>He appeared to be considering whether or not he was going to answer my
questions, and I told him that I had just come from the third floor, and had
been looking out of the window, and that I had seen Honest Joe, who is a Jewish
merchant there, who operates a second-hand loan pawn shop, so to speak,
specializing in tools, on Elm Street, and who is more or less known in the area
because of the fact that he takes advantage of any opportunity to get free
advertising. He at that time had an Edsel car, which is somewhat a rarity now,
all painted up with “Honest Joe” on there. He wears jackets with “Honest Joe”
on the back. He gets writeups in the paper, free advertising about different
things he loans money on, like artificial limbs and things like that. And I had
noticed Honest Joe across the street when I was looking out of Chief Batchelor’s
office.</p>

<p>So I remarked to Jack Ruby, I said, “I just saw Honest Joe across the street
over there, and I know a number of Jewish merchants here that you know.”</p>

<p>And Ruby said, “That is good enough for me. What is it you want to know?”</p>

<p>And I said these two words, “Jack—why?”</p>

<p>He said, “When this thing happened”—referring to the assassination, that he
was in a newspaper office placing an ad for his business. That when he heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
about the assassination, he had canceled his ad and had closed his business,
and he had not done any business for 3 days. That he had been grieving about
this thing. That on the Friday night he had gone to the synagogue and had
heard a eulogy on the President. That his sister had recently been operated
on, and that she has been hysterical. That when he saw that Mrs. Kennedy was
going to have to appear for the trial, he thought to himself, why should she
have to go through this ordeal for this no-good so-and-so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he use any words or did he say “no-good so-and-so”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. He used the word “son-of-a-bitch,” as I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That he had heard about the letter to little Caroline, as I recall
he mentioned. That he had been to the Western Union office to send a telegram,
and that he guessed he had worked himself into a state of insanity to
where he had to do it. And to use his words after that, “I guess I just had to
show the world that a Jew has guts.”</p>

<p>I, of course, asked him when he was born. He told me in Chicago, March 25,
1911. That he operated the Carousel Club. And also a Vegas Club.</p>

<p>I asked him if anyone else was involved in this thing besides him, and he said
that there was not.</p>

<p>I asked him if he knew Oswald before this thing happened, and he said he did
not. He said that he had been a labor organizer years ago.</p>

<p>I asked him if he had ever been convicted of any offense or done any time,
and he said no felony, that he had a JP release in 1954—in other words, he had
been arrested but released by the JP in 1954.</p>

<p>I asked him what his father’s name was, and he said his name was Joseph
Rubenstein.</p>

<p>I asked him where his father was born, and he said Russia.</p>

<p>I asked him if his mother was living, and he said no, that she was deceased,
and that she was born in Poland. That he was of the Jewish faith.</p>

<p>I asked him if he had an attorney, and he said he had Stanley Kaufman, a
civil attorney, as his attorney. And I recall, I believe that is about—that about
terminated the conversation at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you not ask him why he had the gun with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Oh, yes; I did.</p>

<p>I asked him why he had that gun, and he said that he carried a gun because
of the fact that he carried large quantities of money from his business, or from
the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall whether he made any comment to you or in your
hearing regarding the way he got into the basement area where he shot
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. At that time, I do not. I do not recall asking him how he
got in. I made no notes to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember him saying then anything about that he had
intended to shoot Oswald and had formed that intent as early as Friday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He did not comment at all about his intent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; nothing except his response to my question as to “Jack,
why?”, and then his relating as I have told you there a moment ago.</p>

<p>In other words, after I <span class="locked">got——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he mention anything about he intended to shoot him three
times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I did not hear that statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, the only comments that you heard him state
which bear upon intent are those you have already made—that is to say,
somebody had to do it, and also that he wanted to show the world that a Jew
had guts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I did not hear him say that somebody had to do it. I
heard him say that he guessed he had worked himself into a state of insanity
to where he had to do it, felt he had to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But he did make the report saying he felt he had to show the
world that a Jew had guts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes; that was very plain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when you left, who left with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. As I recall, I went by myself, because when I got the information
about his background, as I related here, and got his correct name and
the information that he was operating alone on this thing, that no one else
was involved with him, and he did not know Oswald, I then left in order to
telephone that information to my headquarters in Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you state positively, therefore, to us that when you left
Dean was in the room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I think he must have been, because, as I recall it, I went down
on the elevator by myself with the elevator operator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And Dean was in the room at all times you were talking to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. As far as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He did not leave with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The two other officers who were in uniform I think you said,
who were in the room at first, they were there all the time too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. As far as I know; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They did not leave when you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And if anybody else came in afterwards, they did not leave
when you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>As I recall it, I think I went down alone, just the elevator operator and
myself. Of course he had my sidearm. I had to get my sidearm from him.
If there was anyone else there, I didn’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had to get your <span class="locked">sidearm——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. From the elevator operator.</p>

<p>In other words, you are not permitted to carry a gun inside the jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You saw him again later that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us what time, under what circumstances, where,
who was present, and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I do not remember just exactly the time, but it was some time
after that when Jack Ruby was brought to Captain Fritz’ office, and Captain
Fritz questioned him. I was present at that time and heard Captain Fritz
interrogate him and made some notes and wrote them up. And I also at that
time asked him a few questions myself, on some points I wanted to clarify.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you there from the beginning of the interview between
Ruby and Fritz, or did you arrive when it was already going on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I was there at the beginning, because I heard Captain
Fritz tell him of course he did not have to make a statement and so on and so
forth, and Ruby said, “Well, I will answer your questions, but some of them I
may not want to answer, and I will tell you so.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you introduced to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I had talked to him up in the jail there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you present during the entire interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. As I recall it, I was, on that one interview.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us who else was present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I do not recall who else was there.</p>

<p>As I recall, there was other officers there in the room with Captain Fritz, but
I do not recall who.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you say you had made notes as Captain Fritz was interrogating
him. Do you have those notes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes; I have the notes here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have notes also of the first interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes; I read some of the stuff awhile ago from those notes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there any reason of security or otherwise why we could not
get photostats of them for the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>They may not mean much to anyone else, because it is just something jotted
down to refresh my memory. They are not in very good order, or anything
like that. And I don’t know whether it would mean too much to anyone else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
As far as I <span class="locked">know——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have no objections?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I take it those notes were made contemporaneously with the
interviews, as they went on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. The ones of Ruby were; yes.
Now, there is other stuff in here that had nothing to do with that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, we are interested of course only in the Ruby ones. But
you testified a little while ago, and you seemed to be referring to notes, about
what Ruby said, and what happened and so forth in the first interview, and
then also in the second interview.</p>

<p>The notes that you referred to on both occasions were made contemporaneously
with the interview. That is, they were not made at a later date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is correct.
Now, there is other stuff in this notebook. Like I went up to the identification
bureau to check on his record and so forth, and got his detailed description,
and his fingerprint classification—that had nothing to do with the interview.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I think we ought to take that to show what the practice was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If you do not mind, we will have them photostated, and after
we get the photostats, we will get them an identification number.</p>

<p>Suppose you tell us, then, what occurred at the second interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Continuing with what I started out with a moment ago there,
he—incidentally, I have noted here on this page where I made these notations
“3:15 p.m.,” I assume that is possibly the time this interrogation took place.</p>

<p>I do have the date, “11-24-63.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The beginning of the notes relating to the interview in Captain
Fritz’ office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is your testimony now it would be your custom, as I understand
it, to put the time at the beginning of the notes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Ordinarily we do. In this other one, I did not put the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. He gave his name as Jack Leon Ruby. He was asked about
who his attorneys were, and he said that he was going to get Tom Howard and
possibly Fred Brunner, and Stanley Kaufman, a civil attorney, and Jim Arnton.
In other words, he was going to consider those and C. A. Droby.</p>

<p>He said that his name was changed in Dallas.</p>

<p>Now, I might put in here as an explanation that these are in response to
questions that Captain Fritz was asking him. That he had this gun for 2 or 3
years. That George Senator was a roommate. That he came in the basement—the
word “basement” is not shown here—he came in off Main Street, off of the
ramp. That he felt that Oswald was a Red, and that he was alone on this
assassination. That he saw Oswald in the showup room, or a similar room.
That he knew who he was going for. That he did not want to be a martyr.
That he had built up—was a buildup of grievance. That he had closed both
clubs.</p>

<p>And I have the notation here “Vegas, Oaklawn, 3508, Carousel, 1312½ Commerce.”
That he never saw the man before this thing took place, referring to
the time that he was down at the police station, or city hall, rather. That
he had been in the mail-order business. That he had been a labor organizer.
That he was fond of the police department.</p>

<p>And when Police Officer Slick had been killed—that is all I have in the
notes, but he said that he grieved about that.</p>

<p>That he had been around Saturday night, that people were laughing, no one
was in mourning. That he had seen a eulogy on TV. That he saw the President’s
brother, Bobby, on TV. That he guessed that there was created a
moment of insanity. That he read about the letter that someone sent to little
Caroline. That he knows the police department is wonderful. That his heart
was with the police department. That he had hoped that if ever there was
an opportunity—that he had hoped there was an opportunity for him to participate
in a police battle, and he could be a part of it, meaning on the side of
the police.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
That his mother and dad were separated for 25 years. That he owes Uncle
Sam a big piece of money. That he has love for the city of Dallas—for the
city—he did not say Dallas. That his sister was operated on recently, she was
hysterical about the President. That he went to the synagogue Friday night,
heard a eulogy. And he had been grieving from that time on. That he went
over to where the President was shot.</p>

<p>He wanted Captain Fritz to not hate him for what he had done. That when
he was with the union, that one of his dear friends was killed, he came to the
place where it happened. Leon Cook was the man. That Ruby’s mother told
him to leave. That he was in the union Scrap Iron and Junk Dealers Association.
That a man by the name of Jim Martin killed Cook. That Martin was
political and had affiliations and got out of it.</p>

<p>That his roommate sold postcards. That his politics were Democratic, but he
voted for the man.</p>

<p>That Sammy Ruby, a brother, who services washaterias. Another brother,
Earl Ruby, in Detroit, who operated a cleaning plant. Another brother, Hyman
Rubenstein, in Chicago, a salesman.</p>

<p>That he had also sold twist boards. That he would not think of committing
a felony. That Tom O’Grady, a Catholic, formerly with the police department,
had called him, that he had called Sims, who is one of the members of the
police department, and wanted to bring sandwiches for them, because he knew
they were having a tough time, and that Sims said that it wasn’t needed.</p>

<p>That he tried to locate—anyway, it was some of the TV people to give them to.
And that is when he went to the showup room. And that is the first time that
he had even seen anyone like that, referring to Oswald.</p>

<p>That he had seen Henry, meaning Henry Wade, the district attorney, talking
to someone. That KLIF, the radio station there, had been good to him. No
one else was involved.</p>

<p>That is my notes—“no one else involved”—meaning there was no one else
involved with him, Ruby, in connection with the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, was this a sort of monologue on his part, or response to
questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; as I said a moment ago, that was in response to questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, thus far have you covered only the part of the interview
which was conducted by Fritz, or was some of that the result of your questioning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. About the only thing that I recall questioning him about was
possibly the correct address on the night club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know if anyone asked him how he got in?</p>

<p>I think perhaps you have testified to that already.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, Captain Fritz asked him that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he said he came in through the ramp, I believe you said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he state at any time during that interview about any intent
to kill Oswald, to shoot him three times, and he is glad he was dead?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I do not recall that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I am going to show you a document which is actually a
photostatic copy, or Xerox copy, of Commission Document 354, consisting of
four pages. I am going to mark that document for identification as follows,
to wit, “Deposition of Forrest Sorrels, Washington, D.C., May 6, 1964,” and I
am signing my name to that, all of which is on the right margin of the first
page. I am placing my initials in the lower right-hand corner of the second,
third, and fourth pages. I ask you if you can identify this document, or rather,
the photostatic copy? Would you state what it is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. This is a photocopy of a memorandum report titled “Assassination
of President Kennedy,” the second line of that caption, “Jack Leon Ruby—slayer
of Lee Harvey Oswald, charged with murder of President Kennedy.”
Submitted by me, Forrest V. Sorrels, on February 3, 1964. And it consists of
three full pages and a portion of—about a fifth of the fourth page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think your signature, or, rather, a photostatic copy of your
signature is on the front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is correct—on the front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the report that you submitted to your superiors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. In Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which ultimately, of course, they sent. The report covers the
events of November 24, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know why it was filed on February 3?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Why it was written on February 3? I was instructed by Inspector
Kelley to write up a memorandum on the interview that I had with
Jack Ruby, shortly after Oswald was shot by Ruby, and also the interview that
was had with Captain Fritz and Ruby at which I was present on the same date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you receive those instructions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I cannot say exactly when I received them—probably within a
day or two, or it could have been longer, because due to the press of other work
and things arising out of the assassination, and its duties, the other duties, it
was not written as soon as it should have been. And I may have been instructed
some time before that to—as quick as I could to get the memorandum prepared.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I mean is that normally you would write such a report
as this in any case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, that is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And normally it would be written <span class="locked">sooner——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Sooner, that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Than 2 months or so afterwards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is what I am asking—if you can tell us what was the
cause of the delay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Well, it is just the fact that we were burdened with all the
additional work and things brought about by this assassination and investigation
and so forth. I guess you could term it, possibly, negligence on my part
for not just taking time off and doing it. That is about the only explanation
I can give for that. It was not any willful intent to not write it or anything
to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is no suggestion as to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I know. But that is just as a matter of explanation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think it was written on that date because Mr. Kelley told
you shortly before that date, to wit, February 3, that you should write it, or is
it your impression that Mr. Kelley had told you long before it was written to
write it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. There is a possibility that he may have told me before. I don’t
recall it specifically. But I do know that Inspector Kelley had instructed me to
write up the report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall having a conversation with Mr. Burt Griffin, the
gentleman who is in the office now, concerning what you knew about what
Ruby had said in your interviews with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes; I do. And that refreshed my memory a bit, because I
recall that Inspector Kelley, after I had talked to Mr. Griffin on the telephone—Inspector
Kelley told me to get it written up, get it in writing, about the interview,
and get it in. I remember that now, since you mention it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that actually the report was written because Inspector
Kelley instructed you to do so, and as you recall it he did so because of the conversation
with Mr. Griffin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I would surmise that, because, as I recall it now, either right
after I got through talking to Mr. Griffin or shortly thereafter, Mr. Kelley did
instruct me to get the interview, as I recall it, in a report, and get it in to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But normally I think you said this report would have been written
anyhow, without any suggestion by Mr. Kelley or anybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it was your intent to write it, you say, but you didn’t get
around to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is about the best explanation I know to make on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, do you recall a conversation with Chief Curry with
respect to what you knew that Ruby had said?</p>

<p>Perhaps I can identify the conversation a bit more by saying to you that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
had to do with a suggestion by you as to what the witnesses who were members
of the police department might be called in the prosecution.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Oh, yes; I remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us, first of all, when it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. As I recall, it was after the trial of Ruby had started, or along
about the time it was beginning to start. I contacted Chief Curry and told
<span class="locked">him——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is this by phone, or was it by personal interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; as I recall it was by phone—that there were two uniformed
police officers that were present when I talked to Ruby on the fifth
floor of the city jail on the morning of November 24, and that I had not
warned Ruby of his constitutional rights and did not know whether or not
the statement that he had made to me would be admissible in a trial in the
event that the district attorney wanted to use it.</p>

<p>But——</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you been at that time consulted by the district attorney
with reference to your being a possible witness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I do not recall that I had.</p>

<p>Now, here is something that will establish that. The district attorney, Henry
Wade, came to Washington—I don’t know whether it was in connection with
talking to the Commission or what—but I saw him out at the airport, and he
said to <span class="locked">me——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What airport?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. This was before the trial—Love Field, in Dallas.</p>

<p>He was coming to Washington. And he said to me, “I want to talk to you
when I get back about this case.”</p>

<p>And I said, “All right.”</p>

<p>And I did not hear anything more from Mr. Wade until the trial was actually
in progress. He asked me to come to his office, which I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is Wade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is Henry Wade; yes, sir, the State district attorney that
prosecuted Ruby for the murder of Oswald.</p>

<p>And, at that time, I related to him the conversation I had had with Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you relate to him in that interview approximately what
you have told us today about your interviews with Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Only the one up in the jail—I was talking about that. I didn’t
go into detail about this one where Captain Fritz was interviewing him. That
was only there at the jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there any reason why one was talked about and not the
other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; no particular reason, excepting that I just assumed that
Captain Fritz would be the one if there was any testimony as to the second
interview—would be the one to testify in that case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Wade know that you were present at both?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I would not say positive, but it seems to me that it was mentioned
that I was present when we talked, but I am not positive on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did this interview with Wade occur before or after the telephone
conversation with Curry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; that was afterwards. That was after the trial started.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, which was afterwards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. The interview with Mr. Wade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That came after the telephone conversation with Curry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Mr. Wade consider using you as a witness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. He said if he needed me, he would let me know—in other words,
would get in touch with me.</p>

<p>He said, “Now, the defense may subpoena you on this thing.”</p>

<p>And defense attorney—one of them was in on that case—did call me on the
telephone. They wanted me to meet with either Tonahill or Belli, or maybe
both of them. And I told them I was extremely busy.</p>

<p>He said, “How about having dinner with us?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
I said, “No; I don’t even have time to eat big dinners, I just grab a sandwich,”
because I didn’t want to have dinner with them.</p>

<p>They called me a second time, because there had been a delay from the time
they thought they were going to call me—they called me the second time
and that is when they said something about having dinner with them later,
and I said, no; I didn’t have time.</p>

<p>And at that time I told them I didn’t think I could do them any good. I said
I can tell you in a short time what I could testify to.</p>

<p>He said, “Over the phone?”</p>

<p>I said, “Yes.”</p>

<p>So I told them about the interview with Ruby in the jail up in the jailhouse.
I did not go into detail about the other, because I did not consider that my
interview.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are talking there about the second interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you mention you had been present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I do not recall that I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Coming back to the Curry matter, what was your motivation
in calling Curry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I felt that the testimony or the statements, rather, made by
Ruby right after he had shot Oswald would be of benefit to the district attorney
in the prosecution of this case, the statements that he made as to the fact
that he had worked himself into a state of insanity, also the statement that
he guessed he had to show the world that a Jew had guts. And I also recall
that during the questioning by Captain Fritz during the interview there that
Ruby had made the remark, “Well, I would make a good actor, wouldn’t I?”
to Captain Fritz. And I felt that possibly I could not testify, because of the
fact that I had not warned Ruby of his constitutional rights.</p>

<p>I thought of that before I talked to him, but the part that I was interested in,
that is, determining whether or not anyone else was involved with him, or
whether or not he knew Oswald, I didn’t consider—I mean I considered that
if I warned him of his constitutional rights on that particular angle, that
he might not even tell me that, and that is the reason I did not warn him
of his constitutional rights, because I felt it was of paramount interest to our
Service to determine whether or not others were involved in this thing besides
Ruby, and of paramount interest to determine whether or not Oswald and Ruby
knew each other, or had any connection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it a custom, rule, or regulation of your Service that you
must warn a person of his constitutional rights before you can question him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. On our investigations; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And is that a custom, or is it actually a published regulation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Well, we know that we are going to get in serious trouble in
court if we don’t do it, because that is always—the question is always asked,
especially by a defense attorney, and so forth.</p>

<p>And we know that we are supposed to do it.</p>

<p>I try to adhere to it as much as I possibly can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I am trying to determine is whether that is your only
<span class="locked">personal——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Oh, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Way of doing things, or if it is an established policy of the
Service, and if so, how is it established?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I think it is possibly a bit of both, because it is always my
practice to tell these people that we cannot promise them anything—I am
talking about the people we handle for prosecution in our investigations. And
that, of course, they don’t have to tell us anything if they don’t want to. We
make that known—because if we do not we know if there is a trial in a case,
that that question is going to be asked, and we know that under our laws
that a person is supposed to be warned of his constitutional rights before he
is questioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that your version of what the law is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Coming back to the policy matter, I don’t expect you to be able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
to quote it to me now, but you have the impression there is something in writing
in some manual of standard operations, instructions, that requires that you
warn a person of his constitutional rights?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I just cannot answer that question, because I just can’t recall
if there is a specific instruction of that particular thing or not.</p>

<p>But I do know that if we do not warn them of their constitutional rights,
that we are—we will be in serious trouble in the trial of a case because if the
question is asked, “Did you warn this man of his constitutional rights?”
we have to tell the truth, and if we say “No, it wasn’t,” we would be jeopardizing
our case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, at the time you called Curry, you had not spoken to Wade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Not about the actual interview with Ruby at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At the time you talked to Curry, was that before or after you saw
Wade at Love Field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I can’t say for sure, but I think it was probably afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I am trying to get at is what motivated your call to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I probably didn’t make myself plain.</p>

<p>What motivated my call to him was that I figured that if I was called to
Mr. Wade’s office to explain this thing to him, that the fact that I had not
warned Ruby when I approached him to get this information—that I had not
warned him of his constitutional rights, that I would not—it would not be good
testimony. And my thought is that the two men who were—the two uniformed
officers there, who were just standing by and had nothing to do with the questions
and so forth, who heard what was said, they might be able to testify to
that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you wanted to get that information to someone in authority?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the information was twofold—that you knew there was
someone who could testify as to what Ruby had said, because you had heard
Ruby say it in the presence of other people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And, secondly, you were doubtful as to whether your testimony
as such would be valuable?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know why you conveyed that information to Curry
instead of Wade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Because I did not know the names of the two police officers that
were there. Two uniformed men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, was it your thought, then, if you advised Curry he would
get the names of the men, and then convey it to Wade? I am trying to get
what your motivation was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Well, that is all I can recall as to the motivation. In other words,
I don’t know that I thought that he would convey the information to Wade or
not. I just cannot recall whether I had that in mind or not. But I did have in
mind that possibly these two fellows, these two uniformed police officers, might
be able to testify as to what Ruby said there when I would not be able to do
so, because of the fact I had not warned him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And this conversation with Curry was in between the time you
saw Wade at Love Field and the time you had the interview with him when he
came back from Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. As I recall it, it was. I won’t be positive about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you told Wade, I think you said, the same thing, about your
doubts as to your qualifications.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I believe that I did, if I recall it correctly, because I think when
I was talking to Wade in his office, that that was mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you make any memo of the conversation you had with
Curry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you make any memo of the interview you had with Wade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did Curry say to you when you told him this information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. As I recall it, I think he said that he could possibly find out. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
seemed to me like I talked to Chief Batchelor about that, also. I am not
positive. But, anyway, I figured they would have a way of knowing who it was
that was there, and so forth, at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there anyway you could fix for us more definitely the dates
of these three occurrences—your meeting with Wade at Love Field, your telephone
conversation with Curry, and your interview with Wade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I think that I can on the one at Love Field, because, as I recall
it, Miss Lynda Johnson was en route to Washington, D.C., and I went to Love
Field to be there at the time they arrived in the event that they might need a car
or something. I can establish that—February 16, 1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean you don’t know it now, but you could establish it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I could establish it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I wonder if you would undertake to establish that for us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes; I would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you think there is no other collateral way to establish the
dates of the other matters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I can—I think I can pretty well establish it. I will tell you why.
At the time that I was in Wade’s office, and during the course of the time that
I talked to him, this officer Dean came into Mr. Wade’s office and Mr. Wade
asked me about if I was present when Ruby said such and such things—I don’t
recall what it was now—I think about that he had been thinking for 2 or 3
days about killing this fellow, or words to that effect, and I told him I was
not. And it was right after that that Dean testified in that case. And I think
I can establish about pretty close to what day it was. He either testified that
day or the following day, as I recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What interval of time would have elapsed between your meeting
Wade at the airport and the date of the interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Oh, I think that would have been probably—it is just hard to
estimate the time, but it was before the trial of Ruby had ever even begun.
It would just be a guess on my part, but I would say it was probably maybe
2 or 3 weeks, or maybe even more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, can you fix for us—put it this way: Can you fix for us
whether the Curry conversation was closer to the time you met Wade at Love
Field than it was to the time you interviewed Wade, or Wade interviewed you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I just don’t believe I can. It seems to me like it was shortly
after I had seen Mr. Wade. I may be wrong about that. But I know the
thought occurred to me, well, if I am going to be called down on that thing,
I don’t think they are going to be able to accept my testimony, because of the
fact that Ruby wasn’t warned. And so it was that time that I thought about
maybe getting the names of these other two officers who could possibly remember
the conversation, and they were standbys and were not the ones actually
in the questioning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember telling Mr. Griffin here that you would call
the Dallas Police Department—I think that was in a telephone conversation
he had with you—to find out the names of the people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. It seems that I did mention to Mr. Griffin, when he was talking
to me on the phone, that there were others present, and that I could possibly
find out their names, and it seems to me that Mr. Griffin said something about,
“Well, no; don’t do that,” or “It is not necessary.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, let me ask you this: Would that have been before you
called Curry, or afterwards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Let me see now. I think that would have been before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, perhaps it is this. Perhaps it was that when you had a
personal conversation with Mr. Griffin in Dallas that you told him that you
had made a call to ascertain the names of these people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. It could have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you make such a call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Did I?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I made a call. I am not sure it was to Chief Curry. It seems
to me I remember talking to Chief Batchelor on that. Now, I may have mentioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
it to Chief Curry, too. But it seems to me like I remember talking to
Chief Batchelor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About the existence of some officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. To find out who the uniformed officers were who were there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, would that conversation with Chief Batchelor be
before the Curry conversation or afterwards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I don’t recall that I made that conversation to both of them
or not. Now, I am just not positive about that. But I do recall having made
that call for the specific purpose of getting somebody that was there, those two
uniformed officers, that could have heard that conversation, that could have
testified in the case down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it possible that that aspect of the matter was part of the call
to Curry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I just don’t remember—I just don’t remember. But I know
that I did talk to either Curry or Chief Batchelor, and I am inclined to think
it was Chief Batchelor. Now, when you mentioned awhile ago about the call
to Curry, I, of course, said “yes” on that, because I was thinking about the
call. But since thinking about it, I am not sure that it was Chief Curry that
I talked to at all about that particular angle. But I do know that I talked to
Chief Batchelor about it. I know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, let’s see if we can clarify it. There is no doubt about it
that there was one telephone call made to a high police official.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is what I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are definite that one call was made to Batchelor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. If my memory serves me right, it seems that I did talk to
Batchelor.</p>

<p>Now, whether I talked to Chief Curry on that particular thing or not, I am
not too positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that the matter stands that you are not certain that there
was the second telephone call with Curry at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I <span class="locked">don’t——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, would you have covered with Batchelor the material that
we have talked about that you say you did cover with Curry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Now, what material is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, such as that you were doubtful about your ability to testify,
and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Not necessarily. In other words, if it was Batchelor that I called,
then I would have, I think, have explained it to him. If it had been Curry I
called, I would explain it to him—as to why I was wanting these names, or
given that information to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I am trying to get at, you see, is whether or not there were
two calls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I don’t recall that there were two calls. I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you are positive you spoke to Batchelor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. It seems that I remember talking to Chief Batchelor about it,
because it seems that I can remember that he said, “I am sure that we can find
out that information,” or words to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, if there was only one call—that is to say, if you are doubtful
about two, and you do remember definitely Batchelor, then the one call
would have to be Batchelor, would it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is correct; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I think there is a lack of meeting of the minds here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you try to help me out? I would appreciate it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Let me see if I can clarify this. Was there definitely a conversation
with Curry about whether you would be able to testify because of your
failure to warn Ruby of his constitutional rights?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I just cannot say positively that there was. I do know that I
made a phone call for the specific purpose of informing them of the fact that these
two uniformed police officers were there and could have heard the conversation
that I had with Ruby, and as my memory serves me it seems that was Chief
Batchelor. Now, I may have had conversations with Chief Curry. We have
talked about this thing from many, many different angles from time to time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Let me ask it a different way.</p>

<p>Was there one call to obtain the names of the men, uniformed policemen, who
were in the room when you interrogated Ruby, and a second call concerning the
question of whether you could testify, or were these two subjects covered in one
telephone conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; as I recall it, there was only one conversation on it at that
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. All right. And you don’t know, then, for sure, whether it was to
Chief Batchelor or to Chief Curry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I would say that, if my memory serves me right, it seems to me
like it was Chief Batchelor. There were many, many conversations about this
case from many angles. But I know I was concerned when Henry Wade indicated
I was going to be called as a witness down there, because I felt that they
should know that, and I think as I recall it when he talked to me I told him
about those two uniformed officers being there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, whoever you talked to, did that person, whether it was
Curry or Batchelor, indicate that he was not aware of the information you
were giving him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Now, what information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About the statements made by Ruby. And that you had been
present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have already adverted to the telephone call that you had
from Mr. Griffin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you make the telephone call to Curry or Batchelor as a result
of the conversation you had with Mr. Griffin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was independent? You think it was before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I don’t think it was before, because as I recall it, this conversation
with Mr. Griffin was quite some time before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Sorrels, I call your attention to the fact that on the exhibit
which has been identified as Commission Document 354, as to which you have
already testified, there is no mention of the names of the officers who were
present, and that is dated February 3, 1964. Does that help you to recollect
whether you then got interested in who those people were and called Batchelor or
Curry, or both?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. It probably brought it to my mind that there were other people
present there, and I think I so informed Mr. Griffin on the telephone. But
that is not what prompted me to make the call about the two uniformed officers,
because that had no bearing on what I told Mr. Griffin. What he was asking
me over the telephone is what I had heard Ruby say. And I told him what I
had heard Ruby say. And he had asked me about certain things that I did
not recall hearing Ruby say, and I told him so at the time. And when I was
in District Attorney Wade’s office, the question was asked of me by Mr. Wade
as to whether or not certain statements alleged to have been made by Ruby
were made to Officer Dean in my presence, and I told him I did not hear anything
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, perhaps another approach would be this: You were interested
or became interested sometime in finding out the names of these people.
Isn’t that a fact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes; but only for that particular purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you also wanted to convey the information that you were
doubtful whether you would qualify, as you put it, as a witness, because you
had failed to warn. And that that thought came into your mind after Wade
indicated that you might be a witness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is as I recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that, therefore, you called someone. Now, were those two
things in the same conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. You mean <span class="locked">about——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The inquiry as to the names, who these people were, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
convey the information that you were worried about your own qualifications if
you should be considered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You think there were two conversations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. As far as I know there would be one. Because that is the only
interest I had. As I recall it, I told Mr. Griffin over the telephone that there
were others present, and I could possibly find out who they were, and for
that purpose that he was trying to bring out on the telephone conversation, and
as I recall it he told me, “No; don’t do that.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you find out who the two people were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I could not tell you to this day who they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, whoever you spoke to, Batchelor or Curry, who
said they would let you <span class="locked">know——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I don’t think it was my purpose in finding out who they
were for my own benefit. That wasn’t the point at all. It was my thought that
they should have information for the district attorney—period.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you were not interested in knowing who they
were yourself? You wanted them to know of the fact that there were two
officers there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that you were worried about your own qualifications?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us approximately the lapse of time, if you can
remember it, between your conversation with Mr. Griffin and your conversation
with either Chief Batchelor or Chief Curry that you have been speaking of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Well, I would say it was quite some time afterwards, because this
conversation—I don’t remember the date I had it with Mr. Griffin, but it was
prior to the writing of this memorandum. And it was quite some time after
that that the trial ever started. And when Mr. Wade saw me at the airport
and said, “I want to see you and talk to you about this case,” the trial, of
course, had not started at that time. So it was quite some time afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, what did Curry or Batchelor, whoever it was, tell you
when you told him of this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. As I recall it, they said they could get the information. That
is all that I recall that they said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember when speaking to Wade at the interview
whether you adverted to the conversation you had had over the telephone with
either Batchelor or Wade, or possibly both?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I don’t recall that that was mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any other conversation with any officers in the
police department? I mean about this aspect that we are talking about now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I saw Captain Fritz at the district attorney’s office the day
that I was down there and talked to him, and I cannot recall about whether
or not there was a conversation with him about who was present at that time
or not, because I remember discussing with Captain Fritz at that time that
I didn’t think my testimony would be much benefit to the prosecution on that,
or if it would be admissible because of the fact I had not warned Ruby of his
constitutional rights.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was that conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That was the same time I was talking to Mr. Wade at his
office. This is when the trial of Ruby was actually in progress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was Fritz in the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. He was in and out of there. He had walked in and walked
out. And I may have mentioned to him that—the fact that there was other
officers there besides Dean and myself. And I told Mr. Wade in Dean’s presence
that certain things that Mr. Wade had asked me about, about Ruby saying that
he had been—I think somebody had been thinking 3 days about shooting this
fellow—that I heard no such statement, that I had left when I got the information
I wanted. In other words, when I was questioning Ruby, as I recall it, nobody
was asking him any questions except me, and when I got through I left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you find out that Dean and Archer had said or were
going to say that they heard Ruby say that he had intended to kill him 3 days
before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I don’t know that Archer said that—I don’t remember his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Dean—when did you learn that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. When Mr. Griffin asked me over the telephone if certain statements
were made, and I told him, in conversation with him, the statements that
Ruby had made to me, and he asked me if certain other statements were made,
and I said not to my knowledge, “I don’t remember anything like that,” and
one of them was about whether or not Ruby came down the ramp, and I told
him at that time I didn’t recall that statement having been made, and I didn’t
believe that statement was made in my presence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I thought you said in the interview with Wade you told him
you did not hear Ruby say that he had formed the intent to kill Oswald on Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I didn’t hear that. Ruby didn’t say that. I told Wade that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did tell Wade that? Did Wade ask you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. He asked me if certain statements were made, and I told him
no, not in my presence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you had not heard of that even until Wade
brought it to your attention?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No—not that part. The thing that Mr. Griffin was asking me,
I think, as I recall it, was about the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Wade asked you did you hear Ruby say, “I intended to kill him
since Friday night,” and your answer was “No; I didn’t.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I didn’t hear it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Mr. Griffin mention in the telephone conversation he had with
you statements allegedly made, or knowledge allegedly in the possession of
Dean in regard to what Ruby had said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I remember specifically there was a statement about him coming
down the ramp. I remember that. And it seems that—I wouldn’t be positive
about that, but it seemed like there was something else that Dean was supposed
to have said in my presence, and I told him no I didn’t hear anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I had thought you said that you told Wade that you had not heard
Dean say any such thing. But he asked you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. He asked me. No—you see, he had talked to Dean beforehand,
you see, about this. And I never had talked to Dean. As a matter of fact, I
had not seen him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I might say it was my impression at one time that Mr. Sorrels
said or indicated that in his conversation with Mr. Griffin, this question about
Ruby having premeditated this for 3 days came out in this conversation with
Griffin. At least I got that impression. But do I understand it now to be
clarified that that particular point did not come out in your conversation with
Griffin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I don’t think on the telephone conversation at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. It came out in your conversation <span class="locked">with——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. With Wade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. With Wade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is right. But I think—can this be off the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I would rather it go on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. All right. We will have it on the record. I have had other
conversations with Mr. Griffin subsequent to that time, and personally when
he was there at Dallas, in which I believe that there was some question about
that statement. But as I recall it now, the first conversation over the telephone
was specifically about the ramp incident. And I remember him emphasizing
that. And I recall if such a statement was said I don’t remember it, and I
just don’t believe it was said in my presence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In regard to the conversation with Mr. Griffin in Dallas, do you
recall a conversation which I think I can specifically state would have been
on the morning of Wednesday, March 25—that is to say the morning after Dean
had been deposed. And let it be noted that Dean was deposed on the night of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
March 24. Do you remember a conversation with Mr. Griffin about what Dean
had said then, and that you then told Mr. Griffin what your version of it was,
and had in fact—he asked you to prepare a memorandum or something for
him, so that there would be a record of what he had told him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Along about this same thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, about this same matter, revolving around Dean and Dean’s
testimony about what Ruby had said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I remember that there was a conversation. It seems like I
do have a recollection. It slipped my mind. But since you mention something
about a memo—and you left rather suddenly, Mr. Griffin, as I recall it, right
after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is on the 27th? The question is—you have not written
a memo?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there any reason why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No. As a matter of fact, it just slipped my mind, I guess, because
I cannot recall now just exactly what the memo was. But since he mentioned
that, it seems I do recall something about something I told him, and he said,
“Write me a memo about it.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was Inspector Kelley present during your interrogation of Oswald
on Sunday morning for about 15 or 20 minutes, I think you said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I don’t believe so. He might have been. But I don’t recall
that he was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you have already testified that you and Mr. Kelley went
to Mr. Batchelor’s office after Oswald left on Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. It is my recollection that we did go there together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was anybody else there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. If we didn’t, I met him up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was anybody else there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. At the interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No, when you left, when Oswald left to go down to the basement,
you testified that you went with somebody, I think it was Tom Kelley—went
into Batchelor’s office and looked out to watch the scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think that was Tom Kelley there. Was anyone else there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. There was a number of officers around there.</p>

<p>I don’t recall who all was there. I just don’t recall who all was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know how many officers or detectives were in Fritz’
office after Ruby had shot Oswald and had been brought up to Fritz’ office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, I don’t. There was a number of them around there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have any recollection that Dean was taken to escort you
up to Captain Fritz’ office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, I remember Dean went up the elevator with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember any comment that Dean made in Wade’s office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. The only comment that I can remember that he made is when
Mr. Wade asked me if certain things were said by Ruby when I was talking
to him in the jail on the morning of November 24, when Dean was there, and
I told him no, that that statement was not made in my presence, I did not
recall any statement like that. And Dean said, “Well, maybe it was, after
you left.” And I said, “Well, if it was—if the statement was made, it would have
had to be after I left, because I don’t recall any statement like that.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever find out how Wade or Curry or the police found
out about what Dean ultimately said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Will you read that question again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I said, did you ever find out how Wade and/or the police found
out themselves what Dean ultimately testified to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, I don’t know anything about that—unless it is in the court
records down there in his testimony at the trial. Now, whether or not they
had talked to him before what his testimony would be, I could not say about
that, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Wade or anyone else ever ask you to identify the two
uniformed officers?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever consult with any of your superior officers in your
own service in regard to Wade’s request that you testify?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I told Inspector Kelley that I might get involved in this thing,
and he said, “Well, if you are subpenaed you will just have to testify what
you know about it.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t make a written report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir; not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was FBI Agent Hall present during the Fritz’ interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I couldn’t say. I don’t think I know Agent Hall if he walked
in the door. I don’t recall ever having met him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever hear Ruby say, “You all won’t believe this, but I
didn’t have this planned, and I couldn’t have done it better if I had planned it,”
or something to that effect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. <span class="locked">Now——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I don’t recall any statement like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Mr. Stern is going to take over, and I am going to ask him
to handle the identification of your notes.</p>

<p>(Mr. Hubert left. Mr. Stern requested Mr. Griffin to handle the identification
of documents.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me state that for the limited purpose of having Agent
Sorrels identify three sets of documents I am going to ask a series of questions
of Agent Sorrels.</p>

<p>Mr. Sorrels, I want to hand you a Xerox copy of a document which is a part
of our files, and numbered Commission No. 354, and is your Secret Service
serial 1,007, consisting of four pages, which you have previously identified, and
Mr. Hubert has marked “Deposition of Forrest Sorrels, Washington, D.C., May 6,
1964,” and signed Leon D. Hubert.</p>

<p>I have added the additional designation “Exhibit 1,” on the first page of this
four page exhibit. I want you to look at that and tell me if that is in fact
the same exhibit you identified previously as I have described it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, let me hand you what I have marked for the purpose of
identification as deposition of Forrest Sorrels, May 6, 1964, Washington, D.C.
This exhibit consists of four different pages which I have numbered consecutively
Exhibits 2-A, 2-B, 2-C, and 2-D, and purports to be a Xerox copy of notes
that you made of the interview that took place with Jack Ruby in Captain
Fritz’ office at 3:15 on November 24, 1963.</p>

<p>Would you examine Exhibits 2-A, 2-B, 2-C, and 2-D and compare them with
the pages of your notebook which you have referred to previously in the deposition,
and tell us if that is a true and exact copy of all of the notes that you have
that pertain to the 3:15 interview with Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me hand you what I have marked for the purpose of identification
deposition of Forrest Sorrels, May 6, 1964, Washington, D.C., which is
a document consisting of three pages, which I have numbered consecutively
Exhibit 3-A, Exhibit 3-B, Exhibit 3-C. This exhibit purports to be a Xerox
copy of notes that you took at an interview with Jack Ruby in the fifth floor
jail cell shortly after Ruby shot Lee Oswald on November 24. I want you to
compare these exhibits to pages which you have testified to previously are in
your notebook, and tell me if Exhibits 3-A, 3-B, and 3-C are true and exact
copies of those pages which appear in your notebook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, they are. But there is portions that do not pertain to the
interview with Ruby in the Dallas City Jail on the morning of November 24,
1963—but certain portions happen to be on the same page as the notes made at
that time were made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, directing your attention to Exhibit 3-A, would you tell us
if that portion which pertains to Ruby—the Ruby interview in the jail cell,
and appears on that page, follows consecutively from some point on that page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, from about the center of the page, below a wavy line drawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
across it, continuing on the second page, marked Exhibit 3-B, and the third page
marked Exhibit 3-C, down to the lower portion ending with “deceased mother.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, directing your attention to Exhibit 3-A, would
you read the first two lines on Exhibit 3-A that consist of the notes taken at
your interview with Ruby in the fifth floor jail cell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. “Chicago, 3-25-1911, Jack Ruby (Rubenstein), Entertainment,
Carousel Club. Had business closed for 3 days.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, let me hand you again Exhibit No. 1, and ask you if that
is a true and accurate copy, to sign your name on the first page of that exhibit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you sign your name, then, on the first page of the
exhibit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me hand you what has been marked as Exhibit 2-A, B and C,
and D, and ask you if that is a true and accurate copy to sign your name on the
first page of Exhibit 2-A.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me hand you, Mr. Sorrels, Exhibit 3-A, B, and C, and ask
you the same question with respect to that, and ask you to do the same thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, let the record reflect that I am putting my initials, BWG,
on pages 2-A, 2-B, 2-C, and 2-D. Let the record reflect I have done the same
thing with pages 3-A, 3-B, and 3-C.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Mr. Smith, are there any questions you would like to ask Mr.
Sorrels at this stage of his deposition, to clarify any points on the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, just with respect to one point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Please go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Mr. Sorrels, you testified that in your interview with Jack Ruby
in the jail, you did not warn him of his constitutional rights. Was this due
to oversight on your part?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Will you state, then, the reason why you did not do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. My purpose in getting to Jack Ruby and talking to him as
quickly as I did was to determine whether or not he was involved with anyone
else in connection with the shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald, and also to determine
whether or not Jack Ruby had any connection or association with
Lee Harvey Oswald. I did not warn him of his constitutional rights, because
insofar as I was concerned at this particular interview, my conversation with
him was not—strike was not—had no bearing insofar as the murder case
against Jack Ruby was concerned.</p>

<p>My purpose was trying to obtain information for my service to determine
whether or not there were others involved in this case that would be of concern
to the Secret Service in connection with their protective duties of the
President of the United States and the Vice President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Is there anything else, Mr. Smith, you would like to cover?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Mr. Sorrels, you have had a lengthy session here today. If it
is convenient for you, I would prefer to carry on that part of it that I am
interested in tomorrow morning, rather than to try to finish late today. Would
that be convenient for you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is satisfactory for me, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Fine. Why don’t we suspend now and resume in the morning.</p>

<h2 id="BIEBERDORF">TESTIMONY OF DR. FRED A. BIEBERDORF</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of Dr. Fred A. Bieberdorf was taken at 3:25 p.m., on March 31,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of
the President’s Commission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The deposition of Dr. Fred A. Bieberdorf [spelling] B-i-e-b-e-r-d-o-r-f.
Right?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Dr. Bieberdorf, my name is Leon Hubert, I am a member of
the advisory staff of the General Counsel of the President’s Commission. Under
the provisions of the Executive Order No. 11130, dated November 29, 1963,
Joint Resolution of Congress 137, and rules of procedure adopted by the President’s
Commission in conformance with the Executive order and joint resolution
I have been authorized to take a sworn deposition from you. I state
to you now that the general nature of the Commission’s inquiry is to ascertain,
evaluate and report upon the facts relating to the assassination of President
Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>In particular to you, Dr. Bieberdorf, the nature of the inquiry is to ascertain
the facts that you know about the death of Oswald and then any
other pertinent facts you may know about the general inquiry. Now, Doctor,
I think you have received a letter addressed to you by Mr. J. Lee Rankin,
General Counsel for the President’s Commission, is that correct?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that letter received by you in excess of 3 days from
today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, you are appearing here as a consequence of that
letter?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you stand and raise your right hand? Do you solemnly
swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Please state your name, sir.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Frederick Adolph Bieberdorf.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your age?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Twenty-five.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your residence?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. 8603 Midway Road, Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. At present, fourth-year medical student.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. At Southwestern Medical School, University of Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you happen to be in the basement of the jail of the Dallas
police, on the morning of November 24, 1963?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In what capacity?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. I was, at that time, employed by the city of Dallas, city
health department, as first aid attendant for the—I was employed at that time
as first aid attendant by the city of Dallas, city health department. The nature
of this job is as follows: Mainly administering first aid and emergency medical
care to prisoners within the city jail, or prisoners that they’ve brought in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you been doing that sort of work for some time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. A little bit over a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say fourth year at the Southwestern University, does that
mean that you are a senior?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. That’s right. I graduate in June.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You will receive a M.D. in June?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In June of 1964?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Yes; that’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you go on duty that day?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. I arrived down there about 9:30 in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Doctor, I have shown you, and I believe you have read
what purports to be a report of an interview of you by FBI Agents Mabey and
Hughes on December 5, 1963, which I am now marking for identification on
the first page by writing as follows: “Dallas, Tex., March 31, 1964. Exhibit 5123,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
Deposition of Dr. Fred Bieberdorf.” I am signing my own name on the first
page; on the second page I am placing my initials in the lower right-hand corner,
the same with the third and the same with the fourth and last. In order that
the record may show that we are both talking about the same document, I ask
you please to sign your name under my signature, or by it, and place your
initials also on the subsequent pages. Now, Doctor, addressing ourselves to
the exhibit marked now for identification as 5123, I ask you if you have read it?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. I have read it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it correct and true?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. In the main, it is. There are a few corrections in it and
additions that I would like to make.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Very well. Suppose that we do it this way. If you can identify
by page, paragraph and sentence that part which you need to have modified
by reading in quotes, as it were, stating then for the record, “quote, unquote,”
and then make the comment. I think that the record will be better in that way.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Okay. First of all, throughout this document my last name
is misspelled.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, let’s see. To get that straight, your last name is [spelling]
B-i-e-b-e-r-d-o-r-f?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. And it is spelled “B-e-i,” instead of B-i-e.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Okay. And on page 1, paragraph 2, on the second sentence
of that paragraph that reads, “He stated he relieved a Bill Hall, former classmate,
who had been on duty since noon of the previous day.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what is the comment you have to make about that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Well, he is not a classmate. He is a medical student, but
he is not a classmate of mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Otherwise, the sentence is correct?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Otherwise it is correct. Okay. In that same—on page 1,
second paragraph, the sixth sentence, which reads, “He advised that from his
position he had an unobstructed view of the basement parking area and that he
did not notice if there were any doors between them and the basement area.”</p>

<p>The position that they are talking about that has been previously identified,
I did not have what you would call an unobstructed view of the area, due to the
presence of somewhere around 20, somewhere between 15 and 20 newsmen that
were standing between me and the basement parking area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where were you standing?</p>

<p>Does that Exhibit 5123, state?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. It states that I was standing in the basement at an intersection
of the hallway beneath the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Isn’t that correct?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. That is correct, and I suppose that is the only intersection
of hallways underneath the city hall to the basement. I can assure you on
this [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes. All right, now, in connection with your explanation of the
sentence you have just quoted, I want to ask you what your position was in the
jail basement area. Now, you have examined the mockup which is in this room,
and in order to make a permanent record of where you pointed out you were,
I am marking a chart of the basement as follows: “Dallas, Tex., March 31, 1964.
Exhibit 5124. Deposition of Dr. Fred Bieberdorf.” I am signing my name, and
below that, and in order that the record may show that we are both talking about
the same document, I ask you to sign your name below mine, and then correlating
the mockup and the chart marked Exhibit 5124, ask you to place an “X” and
encircle the “X” as to the position you were standing at the time of the shooting.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Let me look at this. Yes, that is the exact way. This is
accurate [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you have <span class="locked">marked——</span></p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. I drew in another line to represent the wall around the
corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have also placed an “X” in your own handwriting, and I
am writing now the following: “Position of Dr. Bieberdorf at the time of
shooting.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
I am encircling that language and connecting it by a line with the circle
drawn by Dr. Bieberdorf. All right. Now, have you any other comments to
make about Document Exhibit 5123?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. A few more minor ones. Several more minor ones.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Page 1, second paragraph, the last sentence on that page
states “He stated that he then immediately saw Ruby laying faceup in the jail
office lobby, approximately 10 feet inside the jail lobby door.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, your comment.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. My comment is that I did see Ruby’s feet, at least, but I did
not notice whether he was lying faceup or facedown. He was surrounded by a
number of police officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know Ruby at the time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. No, I didn’t have any idea who it was, and that is the reason
that I got so close there, that I thought that this was Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You thought it was the man who had been shot?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. All right. Correction, not Oswald, but the person who had
been shot. At the time I did not know who had been shot, if, any shot—if,
indeed it had been a shot and I did not get a look at the person to see his face,
or even to see whether he was lying faceup or facedown. I could just see him
on the floor surrounded by a number of men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, any other modifications or corrections?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. On page 2, it is actually a continuation of the same sentence
that ends on page 1. On page 2, “And he then saw Oswald in the same position.”</p>

<p>Well, “same position,” refers to “faceup,” and indeed, Oswald was faceup, but
if this is an amendment where Ruby is no longer faceup, better change this to
“faceup.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Okay. On page 2, the first paragraph; about the third sentence
there begins, “He noticed that someone had pulled Oswald’s shirt up to his
chest, and he could see a puncture wound in the left side of Oswald’s stomach
just below the rib cage.”</p>

<p>He did have this puncture wound on his left side, but it wasn’t below his
rib cage. It was—I’d like to correct that “stomach”. Just below the rib cage
to the left side of his lower chest. I don’t really—I didn’t count what rib it
was under, but I believe it was between the two ribs, probably down just below
the fifth or sixth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, any others?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Oh; I skipped one or two. Excuse me. Back on page 1, the
second paragraph on page 1, the sentence that begins near the bottom of the
page, that begins: “He stated this took him several minutes due to the confusion
and by the time he reached the general vicinity of the location—”. This
“several minutes,” I don’t believe is accurate. I don’t recall whether I said
several minutes at the time. I later—well, I think it was a matter of, say,
“something like 1 to 2 minutes, rather than several minutes” and again, in the
same paragraph, next to last sentence on the page that begins, “He stated he
searched the immediate area for several minutes before proceeding.”</p>

<p>I think this, again, is way too long and had better read, “a few seconds,”
than several minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any other corrections?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. On page 2, second paragraph, the third sentence which is
the last sentence, “He stated the latter two,” referring to the ambulance driver
and his assistant, “—ambulance driver and his assistant were riding in the
front seat, and the two detectives were in a seat immediately behind the front
seat, and Detective Leavelle was sitting immediately to his left in the rear of
the ambulance.” The two detectives, and rather than “sitting in the seat in—immediately
behind the front seat,” they were behind—just inside the tailgate
of the ambulance, about Oswald’s feet, and Officer Leavelle and myself were
sitting in the seat directly behind the front seat.</p>

<p>You earlier made the query about when I had left him. It states in here—on
page 2, the last sentence of the last paragraph, “He stated 2 minutes after
entering the emergency room, also known as the trauma room, Oswald was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
removed to the operating room.” He was removed to the operating room via
an elevator, and at that point that was the point I last saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he alive at that point?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. He was still alive at that time. I am just going by hearsay,
now. He was said to have died—well, he was still moving around at that time,
so, he was definitely alive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were with him in the ambulance all the way through?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And when he got to the ambulance you saw signs of life?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Although, I did not until we got about halfway to Parkland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You thought he was dead?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. He—I surmised he was dead until he started moving a little
bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he make any statement at all?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. He did not utter any sound at all, that I heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any other corrections?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Let’s see. On page 3, the second paragraph, “Bieberdorf
states that he was not acquainted with Jack Ruby, but that he did interview
Ruby in the police jail on Sunday, November 24, at about 4 or 5 p.m.”</p>

<p>This time—I looked it up at a later date, and it was at exactly 2:05 p.m.,
rather than my estimation at that time of 4 or 5 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, have you any other on that document 5123?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Well, there are a few more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Otherwise, it stated correctly the nature of the physical examination
that you gave to Ruby and the findings?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. The next sentence that follows that is correct, but then
there is another. That same paragraph, the last sentence in this paragraph
reads, “Bieberdorf states that he gave Ruby a physical examination at this
time in order to insure Ruby had not concealed any weapon on his person.”</p>

<p>This is not correct here. Later on in the afternoon of November 24, I was
asked by the police or Lieutenant—I believe in charge of the jail at that time,
to go upstairs and at the request of detectives and one of the FBI agents, I
performed a rectal examination on him to make sure he had not smuggled—or
to see if he had brought anything in on his person.</p>

<p>This was at 6 p.m., so, I did see Ruby on two occasions. One at 2:05 and
one at 6. I think that report tends to indicate it was only one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It really was two, and you have explained it.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Okay, on page 3, the last paragraph, second sentence, “He
stated he had no knowledge of security measures in effect in the basement
on November 24, 1963, other than the fact that he was asked to remove
himself from the basement, and he assumed only police officers and press men
were allowed to remain.” I think that sentence ought to be deleted and changed
to something like: “I was asked to remove myself from the basement parking
area at—prior to Oswald’s being moved, and was told by police officers at that
time that only police personnel were being allowed in the area, and I, of course,
later saw that press men were able to gain access to the area by presenting their
credentials.”</p>

<p>And that is, I think, the only correction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what time did you move from the first <span class="locked">aid——</span></p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. 9:45. It states that earlier in here. States that on the first
page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you remain in the position indicated by you on the chart,
which has been identified as Exhibit 5124, all that while? In other words, you
were told by the police to leave <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. To leave the parking area, and I left there, and at the time
of the shooting I was at that particular spot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, the spot <span class="locked">that——</span></p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. That I marked on that you have marked the—No. 5124.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Between the time that you left and the time of the shooting,
where were you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. I was, the majority of the time, down at the subbasement in
the locker room. I was no closer to the spot that Oswald was shot—at which
Oswald was shot than I was at the time of the shooting, and no time was I—well,
with the exception of crossing through about 9:45.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when you left the first aid room in the bottom floor, did
you leave anybody in there? Was there anyone in those rooms at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. There was no one in the room. It was empty. The fellow
that I had relieved left the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were those doors locked?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Those doors were locked, and I had a key to them. The
police officer, just before I left, looked in the rooms, searched them. I unlocked
the rooms for them. Now, I don’t <span class="locked">know——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To your knowledge, was there anyone in those rooms at all?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. There was nobody in those rooms, and I had the only key
that is commonly used to open those rooms, other than the keys that the janitors
have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And all doors were locked and you had a key, and as far as you
know, you are the only one who does have a key unless there is a general
key?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Well, I am sure there is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Any other corrections to be made on that exhibit?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. I don’t believe so. I could add, to what Ruby said, or
<span class="locked">what——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, yes; I should like you to say if there is anything in there
that—or if you heard something that Ruby said which is not in your report denominated
as Exhibit 5123, I wish you would add that.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Okay; well, as I stated earlier, I saw him on the two occasions.
Once at approximately 2:05, and the second time at approximately
6 p.m., both on November 24.</p>

<p>At the 2:05 time that I saw him, he, as I stated in this document—Well, let
me just go through what, as best I can recall, what was said. I identified
myself to him. I don’t recall that he said who he was or that either the
police officer with him or the FBI agent with him at the time identified him
to me. I told him that I had been asked to see if he had any complaints or
injuries as a result of the earlier scuffle he had in the city hall.</p>

<p>He assured me that he was not injured in any way. He took off his
coat, which he had on at the time, and showed me a few bruises on the medial
aspect of his right arm, and I also noted a few bruises on his right wrist which
appeared to be fresh, but, he assured me these weren’t bothering him, and
he had no other injuries. He, at that time—oh, I don’t recall the exact words
he used, but he expressed an admiration for the police officers. And in saying
that he had no injuries he stated that the police had just done what they
had to do, that they hadn’t injured him any more than necessary, than he would
expect in such a scuffle, and again spoke of how the police were doing their
job and how they were doing their job well.</p>

<p>At 6 o’clock. Well, excuse me. Delete that 6 o’clock.</p>

<p>He, at that time, did not seem to act—I did not make any observation of his
behavior at that time.</p>

<p>Just saw him for a matter of 2 or 3 minutes during that time. I did not attempt
to do any mental status observation or examination on him, and really
couldn’t say anything, hadn’t formed any opinion as to the state of mind that
he was in at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that last statement of yours true as to both interviews, or
only the 6 o’clock one?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Both interviews. I saw him 2 or 3 minutes at 2 o’clock, or
2:05, and another 2 or 3 minutes at 6 o’clock. Now, the conversation that I
mentioned occurred at 2:05.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No conversation in the evening, in the later call, later visit?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. At that time—6 o’clock when I saw him, I had stated that I
had been asked to do additional and rectal examination to make sure he had
not smuggled anything into the jail. By this time he had on a pair of white
pants and white shirt that apparently, looked like a uniform that cooks in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
city jail wear. He had on different clothes than he had on at 2:05, and I explained
to him what I had been asked to do and we found a little room just off
the main lobby there, and went in there, and he bent over and I performed a
rectal examination on him, and he made the comment that this was the worst
massage that he had ever had, and that is all the conversation that I recall. The
only comment that I recall that he made. That was at the 6 o’clock visit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Any other corrections you have to make?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. I believe that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As to Exhibit 5123?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. That’s all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Ruby, at any time, make any comments as to his motive, or
his intent?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. At neither time that I saw him was the shooting brought up.
I did not mention it and he did not mention it, and it was all the talk we had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me put it to you this way; do you consider that taking the
FBI report which has been identified as Exhibit 5123, and taking also your deposition
today, including your identification on the chart, which is 5124, that
there has now been recorded all you know about this matter, completely?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, have you been interviewed by any member of the Commission’s
staff prior to the <span class="locked">time——</span></p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Not by the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. None of the Commission’s staff?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. I mean by the Commission’s staff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Other than myself?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. Well, not that I know of. I was interviewed, of course, by
the FBI man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Insofar as our interview is concerned, today, prior to the commencement
of this deposition, was there anything in that interview which is
inconsistent with your deposition taken after the interview ended?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. I believe not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Anything of material nature which was discussed in the interview
which has not been brought out in this deposition?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bieberdorf</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; I think that is it, sir.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="CASON">TESTIMONY OF MRS. FRANCES CASON</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of Mrs. Frances Cason was taken at 4:10 p.m., on April 1, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President’s
Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Mrs. Frances Cason [spelling]
F-r-a-n-c-e-s?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mrs. Cason, my name is Leon Hubert, I am a member of the
advisory staff of the General Counsel on the President’s Commission. Under
the provisions of the Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, the
Joint Resolution of Congress No. 137, and the rules and procedure adopted by
the Commission in conformance with the Executive order and joint resolution,
I have been authorized to take a sworn deposition from you. Mrs. Cason, I
state to you now that the general nature of the Commission’s inquiry is to ascertain,
evaluate and report upon the facts relating to the assassination of President
Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald. In
particular as to you, Mrs. Cason, the nature of the inquiry today is to determine
the facts you know about the death of Oswald and any other pertinent facts you
may know about the general inquiry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
In particular, with reference to your duties as a dispatcher of the Dallas
Police Department.</p>

<p>Now, Mrs. Cason, you have appeared here today by virtue of an informal
request made by the General Counsel of the staff of the President’s Commission,
and under the rules adopted by the Commission you would normally be entitled
to a 3-day written notice prior to the taking of your deposition, but those
rules also provide that that 3-day written notice may be waived, and I ask you if
you are willing to waive that notice at this time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Yes, I will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, stand and raise your right hand, please, Ma’am, so
as to be sworn.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. State your name, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Frances Cason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your age?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Age 26.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you married, Mrs. Cason?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Yes, I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then I suppose we should have your husband’s name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Jimmy D. Cason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your name prior to the marriage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Shanz [spelling] S-h-a-n-z.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you reside?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. 2822 Greene [spelling] G-r-e-e-n-e, in Irving, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Telephone clerk in the telephone dispatcher’s office at the Dallas
Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been so employed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Since September 6, 1963. Before that I had a 6 months’ leave of
absence and was employed for the police department for 2½ years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you on duty between the hours of 7 a.m. and 3 p.m., on
November 24, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Yes, I was; actually, it is 6:30 to 3:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Mrs. Cason, I have marked for the purposes of identification
a document which is to be found in Commission’s report 81-A, which is entitled
“Investigation of the Operational Security Involving the Transfer of Lee Harvey
Oswald on November 24th, 1963.” On page 14, thereof, I have also marked
Exhibit EE in that document, the following for the purposes of identification,
“Dallas, Texas, April 1, 1964. Exhibit 5135, Deposition of Frances Cason and
C. E. Hulse.” I have signed my name below that and ask you if you have not
signed your name, for the purposes of identification, also on this same document?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you state in your own words just exactly what part you had
to do with this Exhibit 5135, which you now have before you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. You want me to just go ahead?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. At approximately 11:20, or 11:21, I received a call from the
basement of city hall there from Officer Slack, who works in the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know Officer Slack prior to this time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you spoken to him on the telephone before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you state that you are able to recognize his voice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you recognize the voice then speaking to you as being the
voice of Officer Slack?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; now, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. In addition, he told me it was Officer Slack when he called.
It is not unusual for them to say, “This is Slack in the jail office.” So he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
identify himself and ask to speak to Officer Farr, that is J. G. Farr, who is our
corporal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you spell his last name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. [spelling] F-a-r-r. And he was in charge on that Sunday because
we did not have a sergeant there, and he had asked to speak to Farr,
and I told him Officer Farr was working channel 2, which is a separate channel
that we have, and so he told me, he said, “They just shot Oswald,” or “Somebody
just shot Oswald,” and I told him, “Okay.” And placed him on hold
and told Farr that he had a red light on 531, and I proceeded to call the
ambulance service on the hot line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Please describe the hot line?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. The hot line is a straight line from our dispatcher office to
the ambulance company which requires no dialing. You just lift it up and it
rings from our office to theirs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, then, immediately upon getting this information from
Slack you passed it on to Farr by word of mouth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. I did not tell Officer Farr that Oswald had just been shot. I felt
it was more important to get the ambulance and in time they would know
soon enough. I told them he had a red light, and I knew Slack would tell him
what happened in the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So then you flipped the button for the hot line at O’Neal
Funeral Home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you get it immediately?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. It is just a matter of seconds until they answered, and I
told them that someone just shot Oswald in the basement, and we needed
a white ambulance, code 3, to the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What does code 3 mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Code 3, red lights and sirens, as fast as possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did the man on the other end say to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. He told me he would send ambulance 607, from his office, and
I told him, “Okay,” and hung up the phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, who were you speaking to, do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. I do not know. Sometimes they will give their names when
they answer, and sometimes they do not, and I do not remember if he did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He told you that 607, ambulance 607, would answer this call?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And answer it under conditions of code 3, that is to say, as fast
as possible, red lights and sirens.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened next?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Apparently I must have told Officer C. E. Hulse, who was on
the radio, that Oswald had just been shot, and I had ordered an ambulance,
and by then I proceeded to make up the call sheet, which is just routine work
that we do in the office on every call that we take.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, you have before you Exhibit 5135, which is
the call sheet we are talking about, and I notice written in hand, “605 on air,”
and it seems to be next to the initials, “F.C.” Is that language, to wit, “Ambulance
605 on air,” in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are the initials “F.C.” your initials?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Yes; they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, can you tell us about when you made up that card?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Immediately after ordering the ambulance I made up the call
sheet. I did not have to look up the district or any of the information because
I knew it all by memory, and we have a lot of calls to city hall, and normally
use 2000 and Main, and I knew, of course, it was district 102, <span class="locked">and——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the top of the card shows it is district 102?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, there is also on that Exhibit 5135, and it appears in blue
ink printed by someone in the column entitled, “Ambulance ordered,” the
following: “C—11:12 a.m., November 24th——”</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. 11:21, it <span class="locked">said——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. “11:21,” I beg your pardon. Then the column immediately below
that, “Time received,” “C—11:21 a.m., November 24th.”</p>

<p>Can you explain that to us, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Well, the writing was not on the original call sheet. The
original call sheet was stamped in the timeclock. The only reason I can see
for it is that in the copying of the call sheet, the printed matter did not show
up, and it was necessary to write this in in ink.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, it is your thought that the original of which
5135 is a photostatic copy, has got the time printed, and that someone just
simply wrote it in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. I feel like it was stamped; yes, sir. I am almost positive it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This writing in blue ink that I referred to is not in your
handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. No, sir; it is not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What would have been the normal procedure for stamping
the time in those two columns?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Well, ordinarily, we make up the call sheet before we stamp
it in complete form. In other words, we don’t do part of it and stamp that
and then do part of it again and stamp that time. I, myself, always stamp the
time that the ambulance is ordered regardless of whether it is on the air
or whether it is sent from the office itself. Whereas, some other telephone
clerks may have left the “Ambulance ordered” place blank for the dispatcher
to stamp.</p>

<p>That is, if it was an ambulance on the air call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You feel certain, therefore, that you, having prepared the card,
did put it into the time clock?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Yes, sir. I feel sure I stamped the card twice as to the time.
Once for the ambulance <span class="locked">and——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long would it take you to prepare the card?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Just a few seconds. It is very routine, and it just takes a
matter of a few seconds if you are familiar with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What kind of time clocks are these? I don’t mean the make
of them, but how do they work? Are they automatic?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Yes; they are. They are all electric clocks, and I believe the
name of them is Synchron. They show the time on the face of the clock, and
you insert the call sheet on the place marked by a red arrow, and when you
place the call sheet in, the weight of it causes the clock to stamp the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You do not have to punch anything down?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. The weight of the card causes the clock to stamp the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, is that clock checked at any time as to accuracy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. I don’t know how often they are checked. I do know that sometimes
we find a discrepancy as to the time on the clock insofar as sometimes
when we dispatch—when we sent a call sheet through and the time received
may be—it says, this could have been 11:23 on the time I received the call,
and when we dispatched it it would have shown 11:22, then we would know
that the clocks were off, because we couldn’t—I couldn’t receive a call after we
had dispatched it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, the dispatcher would be using a different clock from you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. And when we find these errors in these clocks this way, someone
in the office usually adjusts them to where they all are stamping the same
time. It doesn’t happen very often that they get out of time, but sometimes
they do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They are not all tied into a master clock?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. No; not as far as I know. I don’t really know how the system
works, but I don’t believe they are. I believe they are all on individual basis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I notice that Exhibit 5135 shows an “M.J.”; is that in your
handwriting?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. <span class="locked">Well——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. These are the initials of Officer M. J. Jackson who was working
on the radio with Officer C. E. Hulse at the time the calls were dispatched. The
way our radio is set up part of the squads are handled by this officer on one
side of the board and part of the squads and the ambulances and APB, which
is traffic investigators are handled by the officer on the other side of the radio
board, and Mr. Jackson was sitting on the side of the board that would handle
a call in the downtown area. That is why I placed his initial on the call sheet,
but when it got in there Officer Hulse had already been talking to the ambulance
and was dispatching the call rather than Mr. Jackson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you stated yet whether you conveyed the information about
Oswald being shot to Officer Hulse by word of mouth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us what happened there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. There is a discrepancy in the number of the ambulance that was
on the call sheet and the number of the ambulance that was told to me that
would be sent by the ambulance company. I feel that the reason for this is
because I called Officer Hulse over the intercom that we have between the
telephone clerk’s office and the radio dispatcher’s office and told him that
Oswald had been shot, and I was sending an ambulance, and it is my understanding
that ambulance 605 was cleared in the downtown area, and he gave
it to ambulance 605, and told me to clear 607 through the office, so, rather than
put 607 on the call sheet, I put ambulance 605 on the air, because he was giving
the call on the air.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, Officer Hulse got the information that Oswald was shot
and that an ambulance was needed from you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. I do not have total recall about the matter, but I feel like Officer
Hulse knew Oswald had been shot. This is my only explanation for it. It was
busy that day and things were confusing, and I just feel like this is what must
have happened. It’s not unusual for us to tell them about things like this on
the intercom that is placed there for that reason, like if we have an armed
robbery they can tell them the location and they can have a squad practically
there before we can make up the call sheet, because it takes longer to make
up a call sheet if you have to look up the district, and we do not know all of
the districts. I happened to know what district this call was in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is why it was easy and quick for you to make up your call
sheet, identified as Exhibit 5135?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, is there anything that we have not covered, to your
recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. I can’t think of anything other than that we did not know the
exact time that Oswald was to be transferred and I might clarify the matter
as to why Officer Farr was on channel 2. Channel 2 was maintained throughout
the whole time that President Kennedy was in town and was used for special
services such as the—if we have a whole lot of extra traffic men and solo motorcycles
and things of this sort to keep them off of channel 1, they set up channel 2,
and put all of those people on that channel 2, and I feel sure that this must have
been the case this day, because they must have had all sorts of extra people
set up for the transfer from the city hall to the county jail and this is probably
why Officer Farr was maintaining channel 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But this call went out on channel 1?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. This call went out on channel 1, but other than that, I can’t
think of anything else I know that might have any bearing on this whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me ask you this: We did have an interview, didn’t we,
immediately before the beginning of this deposition?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you think of anything that we discussed in the course of
that interview which has not been covered in this deposition?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Only pertaining to the squad dispatched, and I believe Officer
Hulse can cover that. Other than that, I can’t think of anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, now, do you perceive any inconsistencies between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
interview and the facts brought out in the interview and your deposition now
being taken?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think that is all, then. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cason</span>. Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="HARDIN">TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL HARDIN</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of Michael Hardin was taken at 4:30 p.m., on March 31, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the
President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of—Michael?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. [Spelling] M-i-c-h-a-e-l? H-a-r-d-e-n?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. -i-n.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. [Spelling] H-a-r-d-i-n?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. My name is Leon D. Hubert, I am a member of the advisory
staff of the General Counsel of the President’s Commission. Under the provisions
of the Executive Order No. 11130, dated November 29, 1963, Joint Resolution
of Congress 137, and the rules of procedure adopted by the Commission in conformance
with that Executive order and the joint resolution, I have been
authorized to take a sworn deposition from you, Mr. Hardin, identified in my
authority as the proper representative of the O’Neal Funeral Home. I state
to you now that the general nature of the Commission’s inquiry, to ascertain,
evaluate, and report upon the facts relating to the assassination of President
Kennedy and subsequent violent death of Harvey Lee Oswald. In particular
to you, Mr. Hardin, the nature of our inquiry today is to determine the facts you
know about the death of Oswald and any other pertinent facts you may know
about the general inquiry including the ambulance call and the documents
relative to that of the O’Neal Funeral Home.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Hardin, I think you have appeared today by virtue of a general
request made by Mr. J. Lee Rankin, who is the General Counsel of the Commission’s
staff. And that general request—rather it was a particular request to the
O’Neal Funeral Home to have its representatives come and have their depositions
taken and to produce certain documents relative to the matter under inquiry.</p>

<p>Have you received a copy of that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. No, sir; I haven’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, under the rules adopted by the Commission you would
be entitled to a 3-day written notice prior to the taking of this deposition, but
the rules also provide that you can waive that 3-day written notice if you so
wish. Do you desire to waive it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, will you raise your right hand so that I may administer
the oath. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you state your full name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Michael Norfleet Hardin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Twenty-three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your residence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. 1311 Exeter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir; it is in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. I drive one of the city contract emergency ambulances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, on November 24, what was your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. City ambulance, or contract emergency ambulance driver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What connection have you with O’Neal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. I drive the ambulance for the funeral home. We are under contract
to the city for emergency ambulance service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you have produced written records which you have in your
hand now. Do you, from your own knowledge, know those records to be the
official records of the O’Neal Funeral Home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are those records relied upon by the O’Neal Funeral Home in
the course of their ordinary normal business transactions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it a normal administrative matter to make such records as
you now hold in your hand, which you are producing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, we’ll mark these various documents for identification,
as follows, to wit: And I might add that although you have the originals we
have compared the originals, have we not, with these photostatic copies, and,
of course, they are identical. Therefore, I am not going to take the original
from you, or even mark them for identification, but use, for all purposes the
photostatic copies that you have supplied and you may keep the originals, or
return them where you got them from. But for the purposes of identification,
now, let us mark the documents as follows: There is an ambulance call record
which I am identifying as follows:</p>

<p>“Dallas, Tex., March 31, 1964. Exhibit No. 5125, deposition of Michael Hardin,”
and signing my name on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Okay, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is another ambulance call record which I am marking as
follows: “Dallas, Tex., March 31, 1964. Exhibit 5126. Deposition of Michael
Hardin,” and signing my name on it. Finally there is a call ticket bearing number
35127, which I am marking, “Dallas, Tex., March 31, 1964. Exhibit 5127,
Deposition of Michael Hardin,” and signing my name on the bottom of it, and
for the purposes of identification and so that the record may show that we are
both talking about the same documents I will ask you to sign your name near
mine, or below on each one of the three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Mr. Hardin, I hand you the document which has been
marked for identification as Exhibit 5125, and ask you to identify that document
for the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. That is the ambulance call sheet—we—that was the original call
sheet from the—made from the call itself, or at the time of the call itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, whose handwriting appears on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. That is our dispatcher, or Hal Priddy, this is his handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is Harold—Hal Priddy. [Spelling] P-r-i-d-d-y?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He is outside in the hall right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir; he is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recognize the handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. I am not too familiar with it, really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is all right. He will identify it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. <span class="locked">Well——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I show you a document marked previously for identification as
5126, and ask you to identify that document.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. This is a copy of the call sheet taken from the police dispatcher’s
tape.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whose handwriting appears on that sheet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. This is my handwriting on this one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As I see it, that is sort of a reconstruction, or amendment of
the first document, 5125, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is some data missing from 5125, which is supplied on
5126, is that right?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you supplied that missing information by inserting the
times, principally, in your own handwriting, which times you obtained from
the police tape relevant to this transaction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All of that is in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you state now for the record that those times entered on
Exhibit 5126, were accurate entries as you gathered them and found out about
them from the police log?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. That’s right; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I show you the document marked 5127, and ask you if
you can identify that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. That is the ambulance—the call ticket that was made on the
call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whose handwriting is that document written in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. That is my handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was it written?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Written at the time of the call, or right after the call was made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And before you answered the call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. No, sir; after we had already answered the call and cleared.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, after the person had been brought to the
hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You then executed that form. All right. Now, tell us what
you know about what happened on November 24, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. We were en route to the funeral home from veterans hospital, and
we were on the Stemmons Freeway, about a quarter of a mile southwest of
Industrial Boulevard, and we received a call that—at 11:21 over the police
radio on signal 19, which is a shooting in the basement of the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have radio equipment in your car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir; we do. It is police radio equipment. Hooked up
directly with the police dispatcher. Just regular police equipment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it 2-way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes; 3-way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Three-way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is the third way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. We can talk to the squads and they can talk back to us and
we can talk to the dispatcher and he can talk, and we can talk to the squad
and the dispatcher.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see. It is customary for you to have that radio machine
open and operating when you are traveling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, tell us what you heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Well, a call came out on signal 19, in the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know what signal 19 meant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir; it means shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How is it identified as being a shooting in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. They gave us the call as signal 19, in the basement. Code 3,
which means emergency, red lights and sirens, and at the time I heard them dispatch
three squads, I believe it was, to the basement on this call, and at that
time they dispatched us to the call <span class="locked">and——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who dispatched you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. This police dispatcher. They phoned—the dispatcher phoned
our office, O’Neal’s Funeral Home and he gave our dispatcher the call, and our
dispatcher in turn told the police dispatcher we were en route back to the office
from the veterans hospital and should be close to that vicinity when the call
came out, so, he, in turn gave it to us, used our call number, which is 605, and
gave it to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Called 605 and you knew that was you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You also knew what the signal 19 was, and what the other
signal you <span class="locked">mentioned——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Code 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You knew what that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I think you have explained all these meanings of signals
in the record already?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. We, as I say, we were on the Freeway about a quarter of a
mile—I guess you would call it southwest—of Industrial and we went on the
freeway, from there to Ervay Street, north on Ervay to Main, and then east
on Main Street to city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you came into the city hall, in your ambulance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Came off the Main Street entrance to the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Describe for the record what you saw and what you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Now remembering coming into the basement, there were police
officers standing there guarding the basement to see nobody got out, and let
us go into the basement, and when—and boy, the basement was pretty crowded,
a bunch of photographers and newsmen down there, and they were moving
this van up the Commerce Street side so we could get in—I mean going up the
ramp toward Commerce Street side, best I remember, now, and pulled the
ambulance up just south of the—well, I don’t—jail office I guess it would be
in there, and stopped the ambulance, and when we got out I started around
the back of the ambulance to take the stretcher out, and there was a police
officer, I don’t remember who he was or anything, but he must have not recognized
me, kind of pushed me back into the crowd. I guess he thought I
was someone just coming through, so, just a few seconds until he did recognize
me and let me on <span class="locked">through——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By the way, was there anyone with you then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir; my rider attendant, was with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Harold Wayne Wolfe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. And I went around to the back of the ambulance, and my rider
opened the back door and took the stretcher out, and went into the police or
jail office, and we saw Oswald lying on the floor there, and several men
around him, and we picked him up and put him on the stretcher and put him
in the ambulance, and then there were two or three men, I don’t remember
now, got into the back of the ambulance, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know who they were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. I believe they were police officers and I believe one of them
was Leavelle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. I am not sure. And then there was a doctor riding in the seat
in the back, there, and then my assistant was in the front seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you know the man was a doctor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. I have seen him at Parkland Hospital several times and city
hall, too, and recognized him as being a doctor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. No, sir; I don’t know his name. He was in here just before us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let the record show that Dr. Fred Bieberdorf was in the hall
with the witness, Mr. Hardin, and appeared in this room where this deposition
is being taken just before Mr. Hardin came in. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. And we got him in the car, or ambulance, they drove the
armored truck on out of the basement on the Commerce Street side, and we
went out behind the truck. Of course, the truck was there when we left, and
then went east on Commerce to the expressway, and north on the expressway
to Elm and then west on Elm to Harwood and north on Harwood to Harry
Hines, and north on Hines to Parkland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what happened when you got to Parkland?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. When we got to Parkland we went in the emergency entrance,
pulled around there, backed up to the dock. Of course, it was pretty crowded
there, too. People had, I guess, saw the thing on television and came out there
to see us when we came in with him, and as soon as we got—took him out of
the car, took him into the emergency room—we got to the hall of the emergency
room itself, and they put him on one of their tables from our carriage, and
we cleared from the call, but there was a few minutes before we cleared.</p>

<p>We were waiting in the hall because it was so crowded that we couldn’t get
through, so we waited in the hall and I imagine it was about an hour, from
the time we got the call before the time we cleared. I believe it was an hour
and 9 minutes, if I am not mistaken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would it help you if you looked at Exhibit No. 5127, to determine
the time of the call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. <span class="locked">Well——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As far as the time of the clearance of the call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir; the call was at 11:21, and cleared at 12:30, and I
believe it took 9 minutes from the time we got the call on the air until we were
at Parkland with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you determine that the call came in at 11:21?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. That is the time that I believe the call came into our office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is what you have on Exhibit 5127?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I mean by that is that Exhibit 5127 was prepared in
your handwriting, but insofar as that time is concerned it was taken off
Exhibit 5125, was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir; that’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is no mechanism there in the ambulance itself which
fixes the time of a call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No timeclock or anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, during all the time you were with Oswald, from the
moment you saw him until the moment he was taken over by the hospital, did
he say anything at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. No, sir; not that I could hear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the name of the patient that you all had
delivered to Veterans Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. No, sir; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where had you taken him from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Let’s see, I’m trying to think. I don’t—we make so many calls
that I—just hard to remember exactly where I had picked him up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Man or woman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. It was a man. He <span class="locked">was——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember where you picked him up from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. No, sir; that is what I was trying to think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nor do you remember his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the number of the car you were driving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. 605.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t normally cruise around, do you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. No, sir; we don’t. As soon as we clear from a call we go right
back to our station. From the time we received the call until the time we
checked out at the city hall, it was just 2 minutes, according to their tape.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what the significance of the code 5, code 6 and
so forth is on Exhibit 5126?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir. Code 5 means en route to the scene; code 6 means
at the location.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And there is another code on Exhibit 5126, that means time of
departure from the jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. En route to the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And code 6 on to that would be arrival at the hospital?</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And 13 means is cleared, in the sense is that you were dismissed
about an hour later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. It all was a little while before that. I don’t believe we cleared
at the hospital. I think I came on back to the funeral home from the hospital
without clearing, because if I am not mistaken, I believe those phones were
all tied up at the hospital and I couldn’t get to one of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Anyhow, from the time you got the call over the radio until the
time you got to the hospital, was exactly 10 minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Let’s see. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you got to the jail 3 minutes after you got the call, approximately,
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir. Well, from the time we got the call until we got to the
jail, and—let’s see, in 2 minutes, because we actually received the call at 11:21
and the call from the dispatcher to us at 11:22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, code 5, on Exhibit 5126, code 5 indicating that
11:22 is the time they put it on the air to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Is the time it was given to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I’ll ask you to look at Exhibit 5125, and tell me if you
recognize the handwriting on the bottom part of that exhibit by the printed
word “oxygen and remarks.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. No, sir; that handwriting, I don’t recognize.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, is there anything further you want to add to
this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About all you know about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. Yes, sir; that’s it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you been interviewed by any member of the Commission
other than myself prior to the taking of this deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. No, sir; I haven’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, during the interview that you had with me immediately
prior to the taking of this deposition, was anything brought out material nature
which has not been covered in this deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. No, sir; not that I know of, not that I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Do you know of any inconsistencies between what you
testified here in this deposition and the matter as to which we look about during
the interview which proceeded the deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hardin</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="HULSE">TESTIMONY OF C. E. HULSE</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of C. E. Hulse was taken at 4:30 p.m., on April 1, 1964, in
the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President’s
Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Officer C. E. Hulse. Mr. Hulse, my
name is Leon Hubert, and I am a member of the advisory staff of the General
Counsel of the President’s Commission. Under the provisions of the Executive
Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, the Joint Resolution of Congress No. 137,
and the rules of procedure adopted by the Commission in conformance with this
joint resolution and the Executive order, I have been authorized to take the
sworn deposition of you. I state to you that the general nature of the Commission’s
inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate, and report upon the facts relating to the
assassination of President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee
Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>In particular to you, Mr. Hulse, the nature of the inquiry today is to determine
the facts that you know about the death of Oswald and any other pertinent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
facts you may know about the general inquiry, and more particularly, about your
actions with respect to putting the radio call on the air and so forth.</p>

<p>Now, you have appeared here by virtue of a general request made by Mr. J. Lee
Rankin, General Counsel of the Commission. Under the rules adopted by the
Commission, you are normally entitled to a 3-day written notice before you are
required to testify, but the rules also provide you can waive that notice if you
wish to do so. So, I ask you now if you are willing to waive the 3-day notice
that you would normally be entitled to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you rise, and raise your right hand so as to be sworn. Do
you solemnly swear that the testimony that will be given in this matter will be
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you state your name, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. C. E. Hulse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. Thirty-one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you live, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. 7825 Gayglen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. Policeman, city of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been so employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. Six years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On November 24, 1963, were you on duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. Yes, sir; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What were your specific duties on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. Radio dispatcher.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What does that mean that you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. Dispatch all calls in the city of Dallas which come through on the
telephone lines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you mean that you can get into radio communication
with moving vehicles and other places through special channels?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What channel were you using, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. Using channel 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Mrs. Frances Cason?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. Yes, I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. She is a telephone operator for the city of Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I invite you to look at the document before you which
has been marked for identification as: “Dallas, Texas, April 1, 1964. Exhibit
5135, deposition of Frances Cason and C. E. Hulse,” and ask you whether or
not you have signed it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. Yes, I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, would you tell us what part you played with reference to
the activities reflected by Exhibit 5135?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. I dispatched this shooting call to 118, and also dispatched the
same call to ambulance 605, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, can you recall how you got the information, or where you
got the information as to the shooting of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. To the best of my knowledge, I don’t remember who told me
that that he had been shot. Some other officer, or some other telephone clerk
in the dispatcher’s office told me that he had been shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it possible that Mrs. <span class="locked">Cason——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. It is quite possible that she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How would she do it? Were you in the same office with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. No, now, I was in another office which is divided by a plate
glass, but we also have an intercom system and it is quite possible she told me
through the intercom system that Oswald had been shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you heard that, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. I knew that she had already ordered an ambulance. I knew 605
had just cleared from a previous call. Best I can remember I asked her what
ambulance was going, what ambulance had been ordered and she told me 607.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. I knew that 605 would probably be closer to the basement, and I
disregarded 607, and ordered 605 on the air.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, now, how did you know that 605 was nearby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. When he heard the call come out on the shooting in the basement,
the best I can remember, he told me he was probably closer to the basement
than 607.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say that you were in radio communication with 605?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Ambulance 605?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he heard the call for ambulance 607?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. I am not positive whether he heard—no, he never did dispatch
607 at all. It was handled through the telephone by Mrs. Cason, but he knew
that there was an ambulance needed for this shooting victim, and he told
me he would probably be closer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Than the other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. Than any ambulance. I’m not sure whether he said that he
would be closer than 607, but he said closer to the basement than any other
ambulance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Isn’t it a fact that you had heard ambulance 605, on channel 1,
announcing to his own company just shortly before this all happened that he
was clear and that you remembered that he was clear and was going back towards
his company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. Yes; that is correct. He had just cleared from a previous call,
and was en route back to the company, which I presume he would be in the
immediate downtown vicinity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And isn’t that the reason why you then, realized that 605 had
just cleared, as you had heard him clear over your radio, and you realized that
he was closer, and that is why you called 605?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. Yes; plus that he told me that he would probably be closer himself,
on the radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I would like you to look at Exhibit 5135 and tell us what portion
of that card is written in your hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. Just the squad number, which I first dispatched to squad 108.
He was on another assignment, so I dispatched it then to 118.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, that the column, or block which there is printed the word,
“Squad assigned is 108,” and it appears to be scratched out and immediately
above it is “118,” is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. Yes; that’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. All that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I notice that there is printed on that card by what apparently
is a timeclock two figures, “time dispatched C-11:22, November 24,”
would you explain what you had to do with that, if anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. The time dispatched, the time that it is explained here, 11:22,
November 24, is the time that I actually dispatched the call to 108, and then
finding out he was on another assignment, I dispatched it also to 118.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Below there there is a block called, “time clear, 1:49 p.m.,
November 24,” would you explain that, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. That is the time that squad 118 cleared from the assignment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And they advised you of that and you put the card in the timeclock,
is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, this Exhibit 5135, was actually prepared by Mrs. Cason,
was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. Yes; it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And she would have had it stamped in this box called “Ambulance
ordered,” and “time received,” isn’t that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then after she made up the card and had it stamped, how did it
get to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. It is put on a conveyer belt that runs from one room to the
radio room, this conveyor belt, and falls into a box, and I pick it up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your—you have your own timeclock there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, as soon as you have done what you said you did, you slip
it into a stamp machine and it automatically stamps the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I notice that there is an initial in the column right next
to the figure “118,” “MJ,” which Mrs. Cason advises was put there by her.
Do you know who that refers to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. Yes, sir; the other officer that was working on the radio with me.
In this—“MJ” M. J. Jackson, his initials, M. J.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, as a matter of fact you handled it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. Yes; I actually handled the dispatching of the call and the
ambulance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why didn’t he do it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. Well, at that time Mr. Jackson was fairly new to the radio dispatcher’s
office and everything was in such a turmoil there I decided that I
would handle all transmissions made on the radio, seeing that he was new to
the office and didn’t know quite how to handle the calls under the conditions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And in any case, you distinctly remember handling the call
which is reflected by this Exhibit 5135?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Officer Hulse, we had an interview now, you and I, did
we not, immediately before the beginning of this deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. Yes; we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you recall anything that was covered in that interview
which has not been covered in this deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. No; I couldn’t. I believe all has been covered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you think of any inconsistencies between what was developed
in the course of the interview and what was developed in the course
of the deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you any other comments that you would like to make
concerning this matter of any nature whatsoever?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hulse</span>. No, sir; I have told everything I know about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<h2 id="BEERS">TESTIMONY OF IRA JEFFERSON “JACK” BEERS, JR.</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of Ira Jefferson “Jack” Beers, Jr., was taken at 9:15 a.m.,
on April 14, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,
Bryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Burt W. Griffin, assistant counsel
of the President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. First of all, let me introduce myself. My name is Burt Griffin,
and I am with the advisory staff of the General Counsel staff of the President’s
Commission investigating the Assassination of President Kennedy. I want to
tell you a little bit about the Commission, what we are authorized to do and
so forth before we actually get into the deposition. The Commission was set
up pursuant to Executive order of President Johnson on November 30, 1963,
and also pursuant to a joint resolution of Congress which was enacted about
the same time. Under these two documents, the Executive order and the joint
resolution, the Commission has been authorized to promulgate certain rules<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
and regulations, and under those rules and regulations I have been specifically
designated to take your sworn deposition.</p>

<p>I want to tell you a little bit about the general nature of our inquiry. The
Commission has been set up to inquire into and evaluate and report back to
President Johnson upon the facts relating to the assassination of President
Kennedy and the subsequent murder of Lee Harvey Oswald, and particularly
as to you, Mr. Beers, we are interested in what you know about Jack Ruby
and about the events of November 24.</p>

<p>You have been interviewed by the FBI, and we have these interview reports
before us, so we have a place to start anyhow in talking about this matter.</p>

<p>You have been asked to appear here by virtue of an oral request which was
made by Special Agent Sorrels of the Secret Service. I don’t know whether
he made it to you personally or to your employer or how it actually happened.
Under the rules of the Commission you are entitled to have a 3-day written
notice before you are obligated to appear here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, you got it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. He changed the date and asked me to come this day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right; fine. But I did want to make clear to you that if there
have been any irregularities or anything that you prefer to have a different
time, we could discuss that. But I presume that you are satisfied since you
are here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. That is all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Fine. Also under the rules of the Commission you are entitled to
appear here with an attorney, and we actually encourage people to have attorneys,
if they so desire, although many of the people, in fact most of them,
don’t appear with an attorney. I see you are not here with an attorney, and
I take it that is because you don’t desire one. But if you do for any reason
feel you would like an attorney, please let us know and we can defer your
deposition or interrupt it, whatever the case might be. I ask if you have any
questions about what is involved here before I ask you to be sworn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. I have no questions whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay, would you raise your right hand, then.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give is the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you state for the record your full name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Ira Jefferson Beers, known as Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you tell us when you were born, Mr. Beers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. July 14, 1923.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where do you live presently?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. I live at 10913 Joaquin Drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Photographer with the Dallas Morning News.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been employed with the Dallas Morning
News?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. A little over 14 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it you have been a photographer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Since 1942; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now I want to hand you a document which I have marked
Dallas, Tex., April 14, 1963, Ira J. Beers’ Exhibit 5350. This purports to be
a copy of an FBI interview report. The interview took place, according to
this report, on November 30, 1963, between you and two Special Agents of the
FBI, Mr. Pinkston and W. Harlan Brown. I want to hand you this and ask
you if you have had a chance to read it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have any additions or corrections that you would want
to make in that. What I am referring to here right now in particular is
whether you feel that that report accurately reflects everything that you told
the bureau on the date of that interview?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. With one minor exception. Shall I just read?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you read the sentence that you feel is wrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. “He is acquainted with Ruby both by name and by sight since
about 18 months ago. He was assigned as a cameraman with Dale Bayse, a
reporter for the Dallas News, on a story Bayse was doing on a stripper school
being run by Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>“This story was for a magazine ...”—I would like to make clear this was
not an assignment by the Dallas News.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. That is the only thing I think of in this particular report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Fine. Now I am going to hand you what has been marked
Dallas, Tex., April 14, 1963, Ira J. Beers’ Exhibit 5351. This is also an FBI
interview report. This interview took place on December 3, 1963, here in
Dallas, and purports to be a report of an interview between you and two other
Special Agents of the FBI, Mr. James C. Kennedy and Will Hayden Griffin.
I am going to hand you this Exhibit 5351, and ask you the same question as I
asked with respect to 5350?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Yes; I have seen this report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are there any additions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Yes, sir; there is a couple in here. Let me locate them. One,
which is probably a minor one, speaking of myself: “He also stated that there
were two armored vehicles, one in the basement and one near the driveway
from the Commerce side.” I think possibly the agent misunderstood what
I said there. There was only one armored vehicle. That was in the basement
driveway near the Commerce Street side. There was another vehicle, police
car, parked in the basement right near the entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now that is a runover sentence from the first page of the report
to the second page of the report, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Yes; that’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you want to correct the sentence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. “Beers did not know Ruby prior to the shooting, nor did he know
Oswald ...” et cetera. This is contradictory to the first report that you just
handed me a moment ago. Apparently the agent must have misunderstood me
or misread his notes or something. I did know who Ruby was prior to this
shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I wonder if you would want to make a change in ink in that
sentence which would reflect accurately what you said, then initial the change
that you make and date it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Let me ask you a question here. Shall I say this sentence is contradictory
to that report, or just change it to that I did know Ruby prior?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. [Making change.] I have written here “I did know Ruby prior
to the shooting, as stated to the FBI in report dated November 30, 1963, Exhibit
5350.” Would you like me to initial this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If you would, please, and then date it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. [Initialing.] This is April 14?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; are there any other additions or corrections?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. So far as I can see, there are no further corrections.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. Well if we go along and something occurs to you, we can
change it even further. Let me ask you, Mr. Beers, where were you at the time
President Kennedy was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. I was on Dallas News property between the parking lot probably
and my photographic studio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you heard that President Kennedy had been shot, what
did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. I was in my photo lab in the process of finishing films of the
arrival at Love Field, and a lab man who works with us told me that the
President had been shot, and I immediately thought he was making some sort
of joke and I continued to turn out my picture of his arrival at Love Field. And
I told the fellow, “Well, go ahead with your joke.” And he said, “No; that is
right, the President has been shot.” And he just turned around and walked out.
And I still didn’t believe him. In a few minutes our intercom between the city<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
desk came on, and I was told to report to the Texas School Book Depository
Building, that they thought they had the man that shot the President in the
corner there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you go to the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. A few minutes later, I did. It sort of stunned me. I guess I
didn’t quite realize. I said, “Okay,” and I kept standing there working on my
prints. And just a couple or 3 minutes, our city editor came back and he said,
“Get the hell out and go over to the Depository.” And I arrived at the School
Book Depository about 5 minutes later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time would you say it was when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. I don’t know. It would be shortly after noon sometime. I have
lost complete track of time for a good length of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About how long would you say it was after you first heard
the President had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Probably 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you got there, did you go into the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. No, sir; I did not. As I arrived, there was quite a crowd of people
gathered around the building, and so some officers brought a disheveled looking
man from the building, and I thought this probably was the person, so I ran
over and made a picture, and then went over to the building. This time the
building was sealed off and no one was allowed to enter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain there at the School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. I remained at the School Book Depository for 2 or 3 minutes, and
I heard the report that an officer had been shot in Oak Cliff. I ran back to my
car, which was parked on Main Street directly across the street from the county
jail building, and notified our office by 2-way radio that there was a report of a
shooting, that a police officer had been involved, and asked them if they had any
information, or if this would probably be linked to the President’s assassination,
and they had no information.</p>

<p>I checked the police dispatcher, and the dispatcher didn’t have enough information
to tell us, so I was told to remain at the Texas School Book Depository,
which I did until sometime quite late in the afternoon, at the time the police
had finished their investigation there in the building, and then admitted the press
to the building, and we were taken to the sixth floor and allowed to photograph
the area where the rifle was found, and shown and allowed to photograph the
area in and around the window and make pictures from the window where
the assassination was supposedly—where the assassin was supposed to have
fired shots from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you give us an estimate of what time that would have been
when you were up there taking the pictures on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. This would be strictly a guess, an estimate. It would be sometime
around the vicinity of 4 o’clock. It was quite late in the afternoon.
Probably later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now in your pictures that you took, were any of the objects that
were allegedly found up there on the sixth floor photographed, such as the
position of the rifle and the placement of the boxes and other materials in the
window from which the assassin is believed to have shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Yes. Prior to admitting us to the building, I made pictures of
a sack, very long narrow sack type of affair that was brought down from there,
and a pop bottle and some pieces of chicken, and I also made a picture of the
rifle which I believe it was Lieutenant Carl Day from the Dallas police crime
lab brought that. And upon going in the building, I photographed the area
where the rifle was found. I photographed the area around the window from
which the assassin was supposedly seated, and I moved into that area and made
a picture from the window, supposedly the window from which the bullets were
fired, that showed a little corner of the boxes which possibly the rifle rested
on. It shows the street down below where the automobile was traveling when
the President was killed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The photographs that you took up there in the window and
on the sixth floor would not at that time have shown the rifle on the sack or the
pop bottle, or the chicken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. No, sir. That was shown outside the building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Do you still have copies of the photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. I do not have copies of the photographs. The negatives are in
custody of the managing editor, Mr. Jack Krueger, managing editor of the
Dallas News.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know what the newspaper policy is going to be with
respect to retention of those negatives?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. We planned to keep them in our permanent file. Not with the
ordinary run of the mill day-to-day negatives, but they are filed in and will be
filed for how long, I do not know, in the managing editor’s office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it from what you have said then, there is perhaps a general
file of negatives or photos that were taken on the day of this assassination
and the 2 days thereafter, which are going to be kept in a separate spot in your
building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. To the best of my knowledge; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know, for our information, and I don’t know whether
we are interested in this or not, do you know if the newspaper has any policy
with respect to making those available, if it should turn out the Commission
would like to see them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. We have made available everything that we have been requested
to so far; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Fine. Is my understanding correct, that what you have in that
file is negatives and not developed photographs, or do you have both?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Primarily negatives. It is possible there are some photographs
that are filed either in our biographical file in the managing editor’s department,
which we consider to be second prints.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are these negatives such as they could be easily examined to
determine whether they might be of use to us without having to develop them
or print them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. That would depend upon whoever examined them; their ability
to read negatives.</p>

<p>I am sure, I, or whoever made the pictures, would be glad to sit down and go
over and explain to you what is in the negatives and what they show.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After you left the School Book Depository on the 22d, where
did you go next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. I returned to the office and turned out my afternoon work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Until approximately 7. Maybe 8 o’clock that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have occasion to perform any more work for the newspaper
that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. No, sir; we had pretty well closed up for the day by then. I
believe this was the day—I am not sure—that—no; I am sorry. This was
November the 24th that I was thinking about—referring to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On the 22d, were there any photographers from your newspaper
at the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. On November the 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; the day that the President was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. I believe that night when Mr. Oswald was apprehended, we had a
photographer dispatched to the police station to make photographs up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Mr. Bill Wentfre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you and Mr. Wentfre the only news photographers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. No, sir; we have approximately 10 news photographers at the
Dallas News.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it that all of the photographs that were taken by all 10
of you photographers that day which had anything to with the assassination
would either be in the file that is in your managing editor’s office, or else the
negatives to the photographs would be there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Yes, sir; to the best of my knowledge, we attempted to collect
all of those negatives and control them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any photographer who was assigned to the Dallas
Police Department on a regular basis during those 3 days, the 22d, 23d, and
24th of November?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. No, sir; we have a photographer assigned there most of the
time, but it was not any one single photographer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you work on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The 23d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall where you were working that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Yes, sir; I worked hours 10 to 7 on Saturday, and I received an
assignment to go to the city hall, third floor of the city hall near Captain Fritz’
office, homicide bureau, and to stand by there to photograph whatever might
take place or whoever might be brought in or maybe any pictures of Mr. Oswald
as he was going up and down the hall.</p>

<p>I arrived there roughly at 10:30 and remained there until roughly 1 o’clock,
1 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In the afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, during the period that you were there, did you see Jack
Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. No, sir; I didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have occasion to return to the police station that day,
Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you spend the remainder of Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. I think, I can’t remember exactly where I spent the remainder of
Saturday, but I think just on general assignments out of the paper there. On
Saturday afternoon it is usually rather quiet, and I possibly, I may have had one
or more assignments, but I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, before you left work on Saturday, did you have any instructions
as to what you were to do the next day, Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. No; I did not. It was approximately midnight anyway when I
left work Saturday night. I had no instructions. And at midnight, I was
called to the telephone and told to report to the basement of the city hall Sunday
morning at 10 a.m., to photograph the transfer of Lee Harvey Oswald
from the city jail to the Dallas County Jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time did you actually arrive there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. I arrived at the city hall just about 9 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you go when you came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. I went to the basement of the city hall, and then on through the
basement out into the police parking area in the basement of the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you station yourself some place in the parking area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Yes; I did. I went into the parking area and was in general conversation
with various and sundry members of the press who were there for a
short while, and I discovered that there was an area along a railing which is
on the east side of the driveway that goes through the basement of the city
hall, next to some television cameras that would permit one cameraman to be
in this area without obstructing the view of the television cameras, so I went
to this railing and I stayed there, sitting on this railing until the transfer had
started.</p>

<p>When I stood up on the railing and made photographs as Mr. Oswald was
being transferred, which included the pictures of Mr. Ruby shooting Mr. Oswald.</p>

<p>Then I remained standing on the railing and shot three or four or so further
negatives of the scuffle that was going on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to hand you—I will turn this around—I am going
to hand you what is a diagram of the basement area in the municipal building.
I have marked this diagram “Dallas, Texas, April 14, 1964, Ira J. Beers’ Exhibit
5352.”</p>

<p>Let me try to explain it a little bit to you. Here is Commerce Street along
the right-hand side, and Main Street along the left-hand side, and near the
bottom of the page, is a ramp which says, “down ramp leading from Main Street
into the basement area,” and following on up towards Commerce Street you
see something marked, “up ramp.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
In this area here is the parking area of the garage. Here is the Police
Department Building. Here is the jail office. This is the hallway that comes
out from the public elevators near Harwood Street so that if you enter from
Harwood you come down to this area, and you go up in the elevators here and
walk through this hallway through some double doors, and you would be in
the ramp area at the bottom of the basement floor.</p>

<p>Now can you, taking your pen, at the time you took your position on the
railing, would you show us where the TV cameras were placed? Can you
mark that in rectangles of some sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. [Marking on map.] These were live TV cameras that I have
marked on the east side of the railing, and there was a sound on-film cameraman
leaning against the railing right there [pointing].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now this sound on-film camera, is this something that requires
a tripod of some sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. It may or may not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall if that one did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. He had a monopod or a unapod, which is a single leg support for
the camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know who that man was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Mr. George Phenix with KRLD-TV.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you put a figure 1, at the spot on the railing where you
stationed yourself first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Right here. Actually on the railing [marking.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You have crossed out one mark and you made a big circle which
you blacked in, on the railing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. May I draw an arrow to point where I was standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. So it will be much clearer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time would you estimate it was when you stationed yourself
at point 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Probably 9:15 or 9:20.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain at that position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. According to the time which we received, and which Mr. Ruby
shot Mr. Oswald, which would be somewhere around 11:21, or thereabouts,
I probably remained there until about 11:25.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So you remained there right at that spot right up until the
shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. And through the shooting and for a few moments thereafter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. A few minutes thereafter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall an automobile moving out of the ramp? I mean
out of the garage area and going up the Main Street ramp shortly before Mr.
Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Yes; there was an armored car parked in the driveway near
the top of the Commerce Street entrance, and there was a black squad car,
I believe I am correct, that backed up the ramp to Main Street in the direction
of Main Street. I didn’t look right up there and see what he did. He never
came back down the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This is a car that you recall driving onto Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. It backed up onto Main Street, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. It backed from the basement and backed up Main Street toward
what would be the entrance way to the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Before that car was moved, was backed up onto the Main Street
ramp, do you recall any car driving in a forward direction up the Main Street
ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall how much traffic there was in and out of the
basement while you were stationed there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. There was several police cars that came into the basement and
out, and if I remember correctly, after this armored car was stationed there.
I don’t recall that there were any other squad cars that came into the basement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
The reason I recall them was because they were stopping there just about right
where I was standing and looking into the back seats and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall a TV camera being wheeled into the basement
shortly before Jack Ruby shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. No, sir; I don’t. A big live camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. I don’t recall seeing that. I may have, but I don’t recall seeing
it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now at the time that Oswald was brought out, do you recall
how people were, newspeople and policemen, were stationed in the basement?
Do you recall roughly how they were spread out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Roughly, they were asked to get into somewhat of an L-shaped
position here, which would be that the news people would be across the driveway
like so, and this area here in front of the cameras was more or less open.</p>

<p>There was some people moving back over here in this area just a little bit,
and then from approximately right in front of myself to up this ramp, towards
the Commerce Street exit was roughly the position that the, this was the position
people were asked to get into, that they assumed that, roughly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you have any recollection if the people were more
densely stationed along the Main Street ramp than along the area in front of
the entrance to the garage, or vice versa, or were they more densely stationed
in front of the garage than elsewhere?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. They were probably a little more concentrated right across the
ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Not here. They were fairly well strung out this way [pointing].
I couldn’t see too far up this ramp here without leaning out and around and
looking up this post, but from my observation, they were fairly well strung
out up toward the Commerce Street exit there for a number of feet or yards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall how many persons deep the people were that
were strung across the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. I am sure that would vary from two to maybe five.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, could there have been as few as 15 people strung across
the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. There was probably more—actually, they came around this corner
just a little bit and almost up to this door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are pointing towards the entrance of the jail office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. The entrance to the jail office; yes. There were actually a few
at the corner there, and strung out across there, and I didn’t particularly look
over in that area because I was concentrating most of my attention towards
the jail office door, because we didn’t know exactly what time they would
be coming out, and we didn’t know what, if any, advance warning we would
have, so I didn’t dare look around too much. I had already seen everybody I
wanted to see, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever have occasion to look up the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. I did look up there earlier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. From where you were in the basement, was it possible to see
anybody up at the top of the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. There was a policeman standing up at the top of the ramp up
there. Looked like he was out on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was the visibility such that his features were distinguishable?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. No; it was a silhouette.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you tell us what kind of advance warning you had that
Oswald was coming down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. I believe there were some of the news media in this hallway
which I pointed out, that goes from the elevator to the Harwood Street side
of the city hall, and the hallway goes past the jail office and goes into the police
parking area.</p>

<p>I believe there were some members of the news media in the hall in front
of the window of the jail office, and someone, I think, shouted, “Oh, here he
comes.”</p>

<p>Then there was just a lot of noise and the door opened and he came in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You indicated in your interview with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation that you felt sure that if you had seen Ruby in the basement you
would have recognized him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Yes, sir; I know his face that well; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it from that, that the lighting conditions were such and
the people were spread out thinly enough so that you were in a position from
where you were to have seen the man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Television camera had a bank or two banks, I don’t remember
which, of light, and the lighting was adequate in there.</p>

<p>However, there was a considerable number of people and quite an amount
of confusion.</p>

<p>It is possible he could have been in there and I had not seen him, but had I
seen him, there was enough light for me to have recognized him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you taking any pictures before it became apparent Oswald
was being brought down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. I think I made up earlier, looked up towards the Commerce Street
entrance that showed either one or two policemen in silhouette at the top of
that ramp there.</p>

<p>I believe I made one negative, and I believe that it was one or two policemen
up there. There was at least an officer there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now you indicated earlier that you had first met Jack Ruby
18 months before in connection with some freelance work that you were doing.
Can you tell us what that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Mr. Bayse, Dale Bayse was doing a story, speculating as to being
able to sell this story, and needed some photographers to illustrate it.</p>

<p>His information to me was that Mr. Ruby had a stripper school, and that
he would like to have some pictures of these, of this school, and these people
involved in the school, the supposed instructors and the supposed students, to
illustrate this article with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Mr. Bayse ever sell the story?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. I believe that story he showed me a copy of Adam Magazine. I
believe that was probably December 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much time did you spend at Jack Ruby’s place of business
taking photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. That particular day, which was the only time I was there in his
place, I spent from approximately 11 o’clock until must have been around 7. It
was dark when I went outside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you visit only the Carousel Club? Or also the Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Just the Carousel Club; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you still have any of the photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Yes, sir; I do. I supplied the FBI with one or two sets of those
photographs, and I do have some still available.</p>

<p>I would like to inject here that I was introduced to Mr. Ruby on this particular
day, which was my first meeting with him, and—but throughout the day
I had little or no conversation with him.</p>

<p>He was negotiating with Mr. Bayse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he actually running the school for strippers or was this a
promotion idea?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Mr. Griffin, this is an opinion. I don’t think Mr. Ruby actually
ran a stripper school.</p>

<p>As I worked throughout the day, it seemed fairly apparent to me that there
was no school in operation there, I don’t think. That is strictly an opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruby did run an amateur night, and from what information I think I
absorbed there, it appeared that these girls must have, part of them practiced in
some of his amateur and semiregularly at his place, and it didn’t appear to be a
school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he running an amateur night at the time you were taking
these photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. I was not familiar with the club prior to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But at the time you took these photographs, did you have the
understanding that he had run an amateur night?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. I got that impression; yes, sir, that he had some amateur nights
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. During the period of November 22, 23, and 24, were you aware
of newspaper people who were operating in the Dallas area on the freelance
basis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. You say was I aware that there were some operating on a freelance
basis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; were you aware of any such people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Not particularly.</p>

<p>I ran into one photographer who was a local man, who I understand was freelancing
and had received an assignment from Paris Match, a French magazine,
and to the best of my knowledge, I don’t recall—I am sure there were some here,
but I don’t recall meeting any that I absolutely knew were on a freelance basis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What I am interested in finding out is if there is any practice
that a freelance person follows in hooking up with a network, or somebody who
can pay him, whether he makes a commitment in advance to work, or whether he
is just down there for shooting pictures or trying to gather information and
selling it as he gets it?</p>

<p>Are you familiar enough with what the practice generally is for freelance
people in a situation, developing news situations such as we had in this period,
to be able to state how a freelance photographer or newspapermen would
operate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. In instances such as occurred there, as the assassination of the
President, there are some photographers in Dallas who operate on a freelance
basis, and also some of them, the same people possibly operate on a stringer
basis. This is someone who is known in the area by a news agency or a particular
magazine or newspaper, and if something occurred in that area, the
people by whom he is known, could possibly contact him and tell him to cover
this story, either by himself, or until some of their people could arrive on the
scene.</p>

<p>I am sure there were some such people operating there. I don’t know just
exactly who it might be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I will ask you one final question. Has anything come to your
attention having to do with either Jack Ruby or with the assassination of President
Kennedy, or anything else that you might think would be of importance to
the Commission that you think you should make available to us?</p>

<p>I do want to encourage you in this respect because I don’t know that I have
covered everything that you might have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. I have tried to insert what I thought, what little information or
comments I might have to make. I can’t recall that I have learned anything
additional since this happened that is not common knowledge to everyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Now, let me also ask you, for the record, whether prior to commencing this
deposition you have talked with anybody from the Commission?</p>

<p>I am not talking about the FBI agents, but any staff member of the Commission
other than myself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. No; I have had no contact with anyone from the Warren Commission
except over the telephone when I was notified and they verified my
address so they could mail me a notice to appear here.</p>

<p>I might go back and add, as far as my acquaintance with Jack Ruby is concerned,
I met him that particular day, and I have seen him in the halls of the
Dallas News in that 18-month period four times probably.</p>

<p>And I think Jack recalled that my first name was Jack, but not until I testified
in his change of venue hearing.</p>

<p>I think that he aware that I was Jack Beers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you a prosecution witness or defense witness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Defense.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it that you were called to testify as to the climate in
Dallas, whether Jack could get a fair trial in Dallas or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. More or less; yes, sir.</p>

<p>It was concerned with the change of venue hearing in Judge Brown’s court
there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I might add also that I did not interview you prior to taking
this deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>I have never met you before in my life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If there is anything else that you think we haven’t covered
here that comes to your mind after this deposition is concluded, we would
appreciate it if you would let us know. And if it is something of importance,
we might want to talk to you again.</p>

<p>But I certainly want to thank you for coming here and taking your time.
I realize you people are all busy, and it is an imposition to take you away
from your work, and we certainly are very grateful that you are willing to
take out this time and appear before us and give us this information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Thank you, Mr. Griffin, you are very welcome.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It is a pleasure to have met you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. I wish I could help you a lot more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This is rather a methodical process we have to go through
talking to people, but you are all finished.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beers</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="HANKAL">TESTIMONY OF ROBERT LEONARD HANKAL</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of Robert Leonard Hankal was taken at 10:25 a.m., on April 17,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of
the President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Robert Leonard Hankal.</p>

<p>Mr. Hankal, my name is Leon Hubert. I’m a member of the advisory staff
of the general counsel of the President’s Commission created under the provisions
of Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, and the Joint Resolution
of Congress No. 137, and rules of procedure adopted by the Commission in
conformance with the Executive order and the joint resolution and I have
been authorized to take a sworn deposition from you.</p>

<p>I state to you now Mr. Hankal that the general nature of the Commission’s
inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate and report upon facts relating to the assassination
of President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey
Oswald.</p>

<p>In particular as to you, Mr. Hankal, the nature of the inquiry today is to
determine what facts you know about the death of Oswald and any other
pertinent facts you may know about the general inquiry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Hankal, you are appearing here today as a result of a
letter received by you, signed by Mr. J. Lee Rankin, the general counsel for the
President’s Commission; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it correct that you received that letter more than 3 days
from this date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you stand and raise your right hand and be sworn?
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you state your name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Robert Leonard Hankal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Thirty-two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your residence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. 3305 McKinney (No. 1).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your occupation?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. I am a director of KRLD Television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been so employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. I have been at KRLD for around 2 years. I have been a
director since January.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you on duty in connection with your occupation at the
city hall on November 23, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I think you were there also on the 24th of November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I have handed you a report of an interview of you by
special agents of the FBI Quigley and Dallman, dated December 3, 1963, which
I have marked in the right hand margin—endorsed as follows: “Dallas, Tex.,
April 17, 1964, Exhibit 5337, Deposition of R. L. Hankal.” I have signed my
name below that and on the second and third pages I have placed my initials
in the lower right-hand corner.</p>

<p>Mr. Hankal have you had an opportunity to read this Exhibit 5337?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That would be just a moment ago; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think that this Exhibit 5337 is a fair and correct record
of the interview had between you and the FBI agents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. It is with one exception, if I can make a note of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. I did see Jack Ruby shoot him—I didn’t know what was
happening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what sentence are you talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. This one—“The first reaction was that Oswald had grabbed
a police officer’s gun. He also recalls seeing a man’s back directly in front
of him obstructing his view of Oswald, and seemed to recall that immediately
preceding that he had observed a blur of movement out of the corner of his
eye,”—we didn’t go into it at the time—they were interested in my activity
more than anything else, when this interview was held.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me go into this and get it identified here in the record—you
are speaking of this sentence—this is the sentence in the second paragraph on
page 2 and the sentence reads as follows: “The first reaction was that Oswald
had grabbed the police officer’s gun. He also recalled seeing a man’s back
directly in front of him obstructing his view of Oswald, and seemed to recall
that immediately preceding that he had observed a blur of movement out of
the corner of his eye.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. This is all correct, but it should be added also—I did see—I
know that man I later found out was Jack Ruby shoot Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you saw more than a blur—that’s what you
have in mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Yes; I <span class="locked">saw——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You saw a blur first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. And then the action.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then your attention was directed to the action by the blur?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, actually, you saw a man coming?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was he coming from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. To my right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How far away was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. I believe since I made that statement it has been paced off
and set at about 9 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, in order that we may have a graphic record of the matter,
I am showing you a chart of the basement area, and you are now sitting before
the FBI mockup of substantially the same area except that it doesn’t cover
all the parking area.</p>

<p>I have marked that chart as follows: “Dallas, Tex., April 17, 1964, Exhibit
5338, Deposition of R. L. Hankal,” and I have signed my name on it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
Now, before we go into positions to be marked on that map, may I ask you
how long you had been in the basement area prior to the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Somewhere around 2 or 3 hours and the night before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you ever seen Ruby around at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. No; I didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And when you testified a moment ago that you saw the man
Ruby shoot Oswald, is it correct to state that you did not at that time know
that the man doing the shooting was Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, you did assume a position in the basement for some
time prior to the actual shooting and it was a rather static position, wasn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. The evening before we were positioned directly across from the
jail office door. The next day when we came to work, we moved our camera
across the ramp down into the parking area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Back of the rail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Back of the rail—we were shooting between the rails.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where were you, in fact, standing at the moment of the shooting?
I ask you to place the spot first on the mockup and I give you the chart to
mark a point at which you were standing after you fixed the point on the mockup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. My camera was here just to the left of this center pole and
shooting between the rails—we have a long vertical zoom lens and it stuck out
between the rails—I was standing outside of the rail of the ramp to the left of
the lens.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you mark on this chart where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. I was standing here [indicating and marking on the chart
referred to].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you have marked a place “X”. Now, put it in a circle, and
I am drawing a line and writing the following “position of Hankal at time of
shooting” is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The camera was to your rear and left, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. To my right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To your right or to your left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. To my right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that the camera would have been approximately like this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am drawing a square in which I am marking an “A” and I
am drawing a line out and writing “position of live camera”—it was a live
camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is the station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. KRLD.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. “KRLD”.</p>

<p>It was there at all pertinent times—right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. We moved and shot up here after the shots were fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But before the shots were fired, that’s where you were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. That’s right—before the shots were fired that’s where we were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, at all pertinent times prior to the shooting you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The camera itself was back of the rail into the parking area—you
were in front of the rail on the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. On the ramp in front of the rail—right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Jim Turner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know George Phenix?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he there too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the relative position between you and George?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. George was to my right, I believe, he was still here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I am marking a position which you have designated on
the mockup as being approximately where I am putting the letter “P” for
Phenix, is that about right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. That’s as I last saw him before the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I am drawing a line and writing “Phenix position according
to Hankal,” is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Huffaker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. He is a newsman at KRLD.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was he standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Well, the last time I saw Bob before the shooting, he was just
outside and to the left of the jail office door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long before the shooting was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Perhaps 5 or 6 minutes before it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t see him at the time of the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. No; I didn’t. After the shooting he came to our camera for
instructions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When they brought Oswald down, was any announcement made
of it at the moment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Not outside of just a cry from a newsman that said, “He’s
coming.” That’s the only announcement I ever heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then immediately thereafter the parties escorting him began
to come through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Appeared at the door and came through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us what was the reaction at the time Oswald
actually appeared into view of the news people and the police and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Well, the physical things that happened was there was a stir—some
of the movie cameras lights—they need more lights than the television
cameras do, some of their lights came on, strobe lights came on and cameras
began to click. It was—at the moment not very noisy as it had been—a little,
oh, a hush fell over us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Isn’t it a fact that prior to the shooting, immediately prior to the
shooting there was a general surge forward?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Just prior to the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Yes—I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean that there was a general movement—a step or two forward
by each person—that made a surge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. A moving forward, leaning forward, of all bodies.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it was almost immediately thereafter or contemporaneously
with it that Jack Ruby brushed through the crowd, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Within the same action.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had not seen him standing there before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. No; I hadn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know how he got in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you present at the showup of Oswald which took place on
the night of November 22 in the assembly room of the police department when
the press and other news media representatives were allowed to see Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see Jack Ruby in that crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. No; I didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear anyone say anything from the rear to Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Well, what do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, <span class="locked">specifically——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. There were a lot of questions, a lot of people were asking
him questions; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there any answers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Yes; he answered some of them—yes—one of them was “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
haven’t killed anyone,” was one of his answers, and I didn’t hear that question.
I believe the question was, “Did you shoot the President?” But if you are asking
me if I heard Jack Ruby say anything to Oswald, I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see anyone standing on a table toward the rear of the
room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. I did not—well, there were people standing on tables in the
back of the room; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you observe them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. I did see that there were people on tables, but excuse me—I am
anticipating your question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell me whether you can say definitely one way or the
other that among those people standing on tables was Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. No; I can’t tell you that I saw him to recognize him. I’m sure
I saw him if he was up there, but wherever he was I must have seen him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But your point, as I understand it, is that you did see some people
standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On tables?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whether any of those people was Jack Ruby you cannot say one
way or the other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. That’s right, I didn’t know the man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And after you got to know him, your recollection doesn’t place
him at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. It does not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, have you been interviewed by any other member of the
President’s Commission prior to this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. No; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I believe that’s all. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hankal</span>. Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="HUFFAKER">TESTIMONY OF ROBERT S. HUFFAKER, JR.</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of Robert S. Huffaker, Jr., was taken at 4:25 p.m., on April 16,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of
the President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Huffaker, my name is Leon Hubert. I’m a member of
the advisory staff of the general counsel of the President’s Commission. Under
the provisions of Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, and the
Joint Resolution of Congress No. 137 and rules of procedure adopted by the
Commission in conformance with that Executive order and joint resolution, I
have been authorized to take a sworn statement from you.</p>

<p>I state to you now that the general nature of the Commission’s inquiry is
to ascertain, evaluate and report upon facts relating to the assassination
of President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>In particular as to you, Mr. Huffaker, the nature of the inquiry today is to
determine what facts you know about the death of Oswald and any other
pertinent facts you may know about the general inquiry, and about the activities
of one Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. Huffaker, I think you have appeared here today as a result of a written
request addressed to you by Mr. J. Lee Rankin, general counsel of the President’s
Commission; is that a fact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you receive that written notice more than 3 days from
today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, will you rise and be sworn?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give will be the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you state your name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Robert S. Huffaker, Jr.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old are you, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. I am 27.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your residence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. My residence is 4700 Eastside Avenue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Apartment 121, Dallas, and it has changed since these statements
were made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Radio television newsman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been so occupied?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Well, I have been in radio and television for, excluding a
6 months’ term in the Army, for 7 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been with KRLD?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. I have been with KRLD since May 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you with another television or radio station prior to
that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Yes; I was with KBTX-TV in Bryan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Bryan, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how long were you with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. I was with them for about 2½ years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, on November 24, 1963, were you on duty with your
employer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Yes, sir; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you in the Dallas police basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Mr. Huffaker, I have shown you two documents, the first
being a report of an interview with you on November 28, 1963, by FBI Agents
Hardin and Rawlings [spelling] R-a-w-l-i-n-g-s, which I have marked for
identification as “Dallas, Tex., April 16, 1964, Exhibit 5331, Deposition of R. S.
Huffaker,” and I have signed my name on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Be sure that that’s “Jr.” because I’ve got a father with
the same name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, I shall add that, and I have signed my name, and
since the document contains two pages, I have placed my initials on the right-hand
bottom of the second page.</p>

<p>The other document is also a report of an interview of you by FBI Agents
Pinkston [spelling] P-i-n-k-s-t-o-n, and Brown, on November 30, 1963, upon
which I have endorsed the following, “Dallas, Tex., April 16, 1964, Exhibit 5332,
deposition of R. S. Huffaker, Jr.”</p>

<p>I have signed my name below that and on the second page I have placed my
initials in the lower right-hand corner.</p>

<p>I now ask you if you have had an opportunity to read both of those exhibits,
numbers 5331 and 5332?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us whether those two exhibits are correct reports
of the interviews had with you by the FBI agents mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. With a few very, very minor exceptions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, will you take first the exhibit which has been identified
as No. 5331 and state what corrections you wish to be made to that statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. First of all, in the second line as it first appears and in its
subsequent appearances the call letters of my station are incorrect. It should
be—rather than KLRD—it should be KRLD.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that’s true throughout the document, if it appears as KLRD
it should be KRLD?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Right—that’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you any other changes or corrections to make?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Well, just to be exactly specific, the last sentence in the second
paragraph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, that sentence reads as follows: “He even noted they were
checking police automobiles parked in the area.” Now, addressing yourself to
that sentence, what comment do you wish to make?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Well, it should be—it should have referred to the fact that
I did note Sergeant Putnam check a police van which was driven down into the
basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that’s the only vehicle that you saw them check?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. That’s the only one that I saw them check.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, that you think that the quoted sentence is too broad in that
it intimates you saw them checking several automobiles, whereas, in fact, you
had reference there to only one, as you have identified it a moment ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. That’s correct, and to expand a little bit further toward this—I
did note that they were checking all over the basement, and I’m sure that they
were checking the vehicles down there, but I did not specifically note them doing
so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, perhaps it would be helpful to you if you would explain
what you saw which prompts you now to say that they were checking all over
the basement, what then were they doing, in fact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Well, I saw Sergeant Putnam and Sergeant Dean and—oh, a
fairly good sized number of uniformed officers who were walking around the
basement area from one end to another and they were searching the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How were they searching, what were they actually doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Well, they were just looking—I cannot say definitely that they
were looking in cars, because I really didn’t pay that close attention, but they
were looking in various portions of the basement and I was well aware that
they were searching the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, the impression of their activities you gained was
that it was a search party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, have you any other comments to make about Exhibit
No. 5331?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Let me say just off the record—this sentence here is incorrect
[indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, let’s stay on the record and let me read the sentence.</p>

<p>“His eyes were focused on Oswald as he approached the automobile which was
to transport him to the county jail and when the shot rang out, he looked toward
Oswald as the latter fell to the floor.”</p>

<p>What comment have you to make as to that quoted sentence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. My eyes were focused on the automobile which was to transport
Oswald to the county jail as it was being backed into position. I had
looked at Oswald when he first emerged from the door, but when the car began
to back up, then I looked at it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when the car began to back up and you looked at it, in
what direction did it cause you to look, to your left or to your right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. When I looked at the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. To my left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, any other comments?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. The remainder of the sentence is correct, because when the
shot rang out, then I did look towards Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are there any other corrections to be made as to Exhibit No.
5331?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. No, sir; to the best of my knowledge the remainder of it is
correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, I ask you to look at the document which has
been previously identified as Exhibit 5332, and state whether it is a true and
correct copy—report on the interview had of you by Special Agents Pinkston
and Brown on November 30, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. The first sentence of the second paragraph could be slightly
misleading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, let’s identify that sentence—it reads as <span class="locked">follows——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. I beg your pardon, it’s the third paragraph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, the quote is as follows:</p>

<p>“On the morning of November 24, 1963, he was assigned to get the story of
the transfer of Lee Harvey Oswald from the Dallas City Jail to the Dallas
County Jail, and went to the Dallas Police and Courts Building for this purpose.”</p>

<p>Do you wish to comment upon that sentence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Yes; this was not the sole purpose of my being there. I was
working at the time for KRLD, my regular employer, and also for CBS News
and I was there to report, and the city hall was my assignment from the
beginning of the morning of November 23.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By city hall, do you mean the building in which the Dallas police
is housed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are aware that there is another building called the Municipal
Building which is a separate building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, that when you say “city hall” you don’t mean the Municipal
Building, you mean the Dallas Police Department Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. That’s right, and from the morning of November 23, the
assignment had been given to me to cover for KRLD and to help CBS cover
anything that might happen there, and our interest on this particular day was
not necessarily focused on the transfer of Lee Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Let’s see—yes; this spelling of the name here of Bob—his
last name is not correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s in the fourth paragraph, the fourth line, and it is shown
as Bob Hinkle [spelling] H-i-n-k-l-e. You say that that spelling is wrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. That the spelling is incorrect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is the correct spelling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. It should be—this was the spelling I gave them, however,
on that interview. I have since discovered that it is H-a-n-k-l-e or “e-l”—I’m still
not certain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think that the man’s name is actually [spelling] H-a-n-k-a-l.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. You are right. [Spelling] H-a-n-a-k-a-l is right.</p>

<p>Now, I believe I did notice something in that other statement—I thought
perhaps it was in this one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you want to finish with this one first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. I guess I had better.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And by this one, we mean No. 5332?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Well, again, it says I “saw them searching the cars”—I saw
them searching among the cars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, I think we can say that Exhibit 5332, with the corrections
that have been made is a fair and correct report of the interview of you on
November 30, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Right, sir; with that change that I saw them searching among
the cars, rather than searching the cars themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; that has gone into the record. Now, you want to go
back, I think, to Exhibit 5331?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is something more you wish to say about that one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you tell us what it is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. All right; it refers to this <span class="locked">sentence——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; the sentence that the witness is referring to is in the
third paragraph—it is the third sentence and it reads as follows:</p>

<p>“He had assumed a station directly in front of the doors leading from the
elevator onto the ramp in the basement and had been trying to keep persons
out of the line of the KLRD cameras in order that Oswald could be photographed
as he left the doors leading from the elevators.”</p>

<p>Now, do you wish to comment about that sentence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Yes, sir; there are two discrepancies in that one. I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
assumed a station directly in front of the doors leading from the interior basement
of the Dallas Police Headquarters into the basement parking area, rather
than leading from the elevator onto the ramp. And, I had been attempting to
keep persons out of the line of the KRLD camera, but this was not in order
that Oswald could be photographed, but it was in order that the live camera—the—because
this was not a film camera such as that that George Phenix was
using, but a live camera—so that it would enable our live cameras to pick him
up as he left the door leading from the jail office into the basement, rather
than leading from the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir; other than the wording of that, and other than
the corrections you have previously made as to Exhibit 5331, do you think it is
a fair statement of the interview of you on November 28?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I have marked for the purpose of identification a chart
of the basement which, as you can see on this FBI mockup before you is a
chart of the same object except that the map covers some area not covered by
the mockup, and for the purpose of identification, I have marked it as “Dallas,
Tex., April 16, 1964, Exhibit No. 5333, Deposition of R. S. Huffaker, Jr.”</p>

<p>And I have signed my name below it. Now, I think your statements previously
given and identified as Nos. 5331 and 5332 indicate that you had taken up a
position approximately one-half an hour before the shooting actually occurred;
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Approximately; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I would like you to fix that position by pointing to it
on the mockup, and then I will mark it on the chart, and if you agree that
it is correctly marked, you may say so, and thus we will have a permanent
record of exactly what position you were in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. All right, sir; approximately this position [indicating on the
mockup].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you are fixing a position almost in the middle of the
middle segment of the railing, which is divided into three segments, by two
horizontal poles, which railing runs from one post on the Commerce Street
side of the basement to another post on the Main Street side of the basement;
is that correct, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you will note that the chart does not show the vertical
poles, but will you agree with me that the black part that I am marking (1)
and the black part that I am marking (2), represent on the mockup itself the
two main poles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you agree with me, too, that looking at the mockup, there
is a railing which runs between those two posts marked (1) and (2) and that
that railing is divided by horizontal poles, approximately equidistant from one
another and from the two main posts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that I’m going to mark, at a point which may not be mathematically
correct, but is intended to be as a number (3), the position of one of
the vertical rails of the railing and the other number (4) as the other vertical
rail. Now, as you pointed out the matter to me on the mockup, am I correct in
saying that you were at this point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Let me see—yes, sir; that’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am marking the point with a number (5) in a circle, and I ask
you if that is not approximately where you were standing at the time of the
shooting and for a period of perhaps 15 to 20 minutes prior thereto?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Well, now, you have the (5) in contact with the railing almost,
and I was farther away from the railing, however, its position relation
to its distance between point (1) and (2) and point (3) and (4) is correct.
However, it was a little farther from the railing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many inches or feet from the railing toward the jail office
or jail corridor were you standing, in fact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Well, to the best of my knowledge, I was probably about—approximately
4 feet from the rail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I have written in my own hand and connected it with a
line to point (5) the following, “position of R. S. Huffaker, Jr., at the time of
shooting, but he was 4 feet from railing.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I will add the word “about”—is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. “About 4 feet from railing.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Yes; that’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, were you there for about 15 or 20 minutes prior to the
shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Oh, I was there for at least a half an hour prior to the shooting.
You mean in that stable position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. No, sir; not in that very spot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, how long were you in that very spot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Let’s see, I could not say for certain, but our video tape which
is preserved and in existence will show me taking this position and will be the
best evidence of exactly how long I was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you give us some idea of the number of people, either police
or news media, standing to your right as you stood there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. To my right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were facing the corridor with your back to the parking area
and your back to the railing, isn’t that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Well, actually, my back was more facing the Main Street
ramp than it was to the parking area. My left side was facing the railing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were almost looking up the ramp that goes to Commerce
Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you tell us who was on your right or what was the condition
of the crowd of people there, how many there were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. There was a large number of people and there were, I would
say, at least 12 to 15 people lined up across the ramp and at the wall, which
is just outside the jail office there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, would you take my pen and draw the front line of those
people, marking the beginning point as number (6) and the end of that line
as (7)?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span> [marking the document as requested]. Now, this line went—sometimes
it went up into here [indicating] and I could not say for certain
whether it was existent at that time, but there were people all the way up into
here, but I would make a rough guess it would be this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you indicate (6) and (7)—in other words, there were
people lined up along the line that you have drawn as (6) and (7) at a single
point on one end of that line, too, from what I gather from that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Not exactly—that is, I’m not certain—there could have been
some more between me and the rail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, in the area back of that line and in the direction of Main
Street, you say there were approximately 12 to 15 to 18 people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. No, not behind the line, but actually lined up somewhat in a
line like that [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the number of people on the Main Street side of the
line which you have designated as (6) to (7)?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. I just don’t know how many people were back there, but I
know there was a line of people from this point to this point [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see any officers on the opposite side from where you
were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you mark another line, curving it if need be, and starting
with (8) and going to (9) and showing us roughly the line of people who were
standing where you indicated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Now, this will be to the best of my recollection [drew the
line as requested].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have drawn a line, one end of which is (8) in a circle and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
the other end of which is (9) in a circle—there were people standing along there,
you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know who they were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Most of them were police officers. I don’t know any of them
by name, but I was aware that they were police officers. That is, I do not
believe that I knew any of them by name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see Ruby come out of the crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. No, sir; I didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you first observe that something had happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. When I heard the shot, I recognized it as the sound of a .38,
and just as soon as reflexes would do it, I turned and saw Oswald as he fell. I
really could not distinguish Ruby from the mass of humanity that was there, but
the thing that I saw when I turned around was Oswald falling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What distance do you suppose there was between your body
and Oswald’s body at the time you saw this? You may look, for example, in
this room and see. Stay where you are and let me stand away from you—was
it this far or farther or closer or what? [Hubert walked distances as
indicated by the question.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Let me see—let me stand up—it was about this far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What do you judge, “this distance” to be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Well, I would say it is about 11 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Did you hear Ruby say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear anyone else say anything which was distinguishable?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Not distinguishable—that is, not at the moment of the shot.
Immediately before or <span class="locked">after——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear anything at any time after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Yes, sir; I did, which I could not quote it exactly, but the
first thing that I distinguished, the first utterance that I could distinguish,
and as I say, I do not recall the exact words, but I heard Police Officer Richard
Swain who was—I don’t know where he was before the shot was fired, but immediately
afterward, he was standing a very short distance from me blocking
access of anyone else, and he made—he shouted out for no one to come any
further.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t remember the words?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. The words, frankly, I think he said, “I’ll knock you on your
ass,” but I’m not certain exactly what the words were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But in any case, in the sense you understood the officer, he was
trying to keep anybody from converging there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. And how. Yes; he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There’s one other thing I wanted to do by way of position. I’m
going to roughly draw a rectangle which will not be in scale but I hope that it
will fix the position of the television camera unit of KRLD which you were
attached to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In the first place, I understand it was on the other side of the
rail from you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand further that some of its mechanisms, its camera
mechanisms were actually sticking out over the rail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. I think actually it protruded through the rail, rather than
over the rail, but I really can’t say for certain—I think it was through the
rail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As I understand it, it was to your back and left more or less?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that although it is not intended to be accurate, but just to
give a general idea of the position of the KRLD camera, I am marking a rectangle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
in which I am placing a capital A and would you agree that that figure
shows, generally speaking, the position of the camera of KRLD?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In order to make the map self explanatory to some extent, I
am writing on it as follows: “Approximate position of KRLD camera.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Well, it might be well to distinguish this camera as the live
television camera from the film camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I will put in parentheses “live,” is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think that it is correct to state that anyone who would
read your two statements, Exhibits 5331 and 5332 and who would also read the
transcript of the deposition and have available at the time they are reading
that, this chart, would have as accurate a story of the facts as you know them
as is possible?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Yes, sir; and of course my story could be—sometimes could
be fixed by looking at our video tape, and by the way, I am sorry—I was going
to look at it before today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We have done that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. I’m sure you have, but anyway I was going to look at it to
refresh my memory. I didn’t ever get a chance to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you been interviewed by any member of the Commission’s
staff prior to today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. No; by no member of the Commission’s staff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you and I spoke a little bit prior to the commencement of
this deposition, but do you perceive that we spoke about anything which has not
been subsequently brought up and discussed in this deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. No; that’s correct. We did not discuss anything that has not
been brought up in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Huffaker</span>. Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="PHENIX">TESTIMONY OF GEORGE R. PHENIX</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of George R. Phenix was taken at 3:40 p.m., on April 16, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the
President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Phenix, my name is Leon Hubert. I am a member of
the advisory staff of the General Counsel of the President’s Commission on the
Assassination of President Kennedy. Under the provisions of Executive Order
11130, dated November 29, 1963, and the Joint Resolution of the Congress, No. 137,
and the rules of procedure adopted by the Commission in conformance with the
Executive order and the joint resolution, I have been authorized to take a
sworn deposition from you.</p>

<p>I state to you now that the general nature of the Commission’s inquiry is to
ascertain, evaluate, and report upon the facts relating to the assassination of
President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.
In particular as to you, Mr. Phenix, the nature of the inquiry today is to determine
all the facts you know about the death of Oswald and any other pertinent
facts you may know about the general inquiry and the activities of Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. Phenix, I think you appeared here as a result of a written request addressed
to you by Mr. J. Lee Rankin, who is the General Counsel of the
President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I ask you now, you received that written request more than
3 days ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you rise and be sworn? Do you solemnly swear the testimony<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you please state your name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. George R. Phenix.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Twenty-five.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. 2550 Klondike.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. I am a reporter—cameraman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. KRLD.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s a Dallas station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been so employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Since the middle of October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your occupation prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Reporter for the magazine Texas Municipal League, an organization
of Texas towns and city of the magazine—Austin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you a college graduate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. No; doggone it—no. I lack three courses. I have been in
college for a long time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you study?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Texas Tech and Texas University—journalism and advertising.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you on duty with KRLD on November 24, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What function were you performing on that day with reference
to your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. My assignment was to cover Oswald as they brought him out from
the police department, cover him, and just to get film on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you were to operate a film camera and you had
nothing to do with the television part of it at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. None at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did KRLD have television machines down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Right—we had a live camera set up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But your operation was not in connection with that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. No—there are really two distinct operations—they are a production
crew, the same crew that handles a TV show in the studio, and I don’t
even know how to operate their cameras.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What you were operating was a hand camera, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Well, it’s a little larger than a hand camera but generally it is
operated on a battery pack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Perhaps for the record you might, if you can, give the technical
description of the camera you were using that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Well, it’s an Auricon, 16 mm. sound camera and it is equipped
with a 400-foot magazine, operated—a hand camera is normally hand wound—this
is power driven by a battery, and it had a microphone and it was braced on
a unipod, a single pole.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is held by the hand and balanced that way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. By the hand when it is on a unipod. Normally it is usually
either on a tripod or a shoulder harness and it weighs about 40 pounds I
imagine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, on the 24th of November how were you operating it—on
a tripod?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. On a unipod—on a unipod.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By that, I take it it is a single stick, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is adjustable for distance from the ground?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Yes, sir—I believe there are three adjustments you can make.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It serves to steady the camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Mr. Phenix, I have shown you two documents which I
am now going to mark for identification as follows, to wit: The first one
I am marking, “Dallas, Tex., April 16, 1964, as number 5328, Deposition of
George R. Phenix,” and I am signing my name below that. That contains one
page. It purports to be an interview of you on November 24, 1963, by FBI
Agents Lee and Barrett [spelling] B-a-r-r-e-t-t.</p>

<p>I am marking the second document as follows:</p>

<p>“Dallas, Tex., April 16, 1964, as Exhibit 5329, Deposition of George R. Phenix,”
and I am signing my name below that. That document also contains only one
page and purports to be a report of an interview with FBI Agents Harding
and Rawlings. Have you had an opportunity to read the exhibits, which have
been identified as Exhibits 5328 and 5329?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you consider that those exhibits represent a true and fair
report of the interviews which they purport to cover?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Yes, sir. Now, the second one updates the first one. The
second one is more correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, the one dated November 28, 1963, identified as
Exhibit No. 5329, goes into more detail than the one dated November 24,
which has been identified as Exhibit 5328?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you perceive any conflicts between them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. No—mainly—I don’t know if you need this for your record or
not. Mainly, there is just a correction in an impression I had. I was located
around by the crew and in that first interview, I thought I would have been
hit by Ruby since he was in front of me, as he stepped out of the crowd, but
then we know—one says we know it wasn’t Ruby—that’s about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, could you more graphically show your position—I have
asked you previously to study this FBI mockup of the jail office, showing also
the Commerce and Main Street ramps, the ramp from the parking area into
the street ramps, and I am going to ask you if you would show us, now, where
you were when you first came into the area that this mockup shows, and
I will explain the system that I will use.</p>

<p>If you will point to the place on the mockup, we will then agree as to what
that point is on the chart and mark it so, and then if you change positions
from one to another, we will so indicate, so that any person who reads your
testimony with this chart before them can follow it intelligently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, in order that the chart may be properly identified, I am
marking it as follows: “Dallas, Tex., April 16, 1964, Exhibit No. 5330, Deposition
of George R. Phenix.” I will sign my name below that. Now, Mr. Phenix,
at what time did you first come down into the basement and into this area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. It was a little after 9 o’clock, according to that statement, it
said 9:10—it was closer to 9 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You remained in the basement area the entire time until the
actual shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I guess it is correct to state you didn’t stay in one particular
spot all that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Oh, I unloaded the gear from the car in the area between the
two stop signs at the level portion there where cars normally stop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you point to that on here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Right here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am marking on Exhibit 5330 the spot where Mr. Phenix has
stated that he unloaded the gear with a number one in a circle there and drawing
a line from that, and I am writing “Spot where Phenix first unloaded gear at
about 9:10 a.m.” What was that gear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. The camera, the unipod, a microphone, and battery pack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You unloaded it from a truck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. The Mobile News Unit—it is a station wagon we normally
drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have I marked the spot correctly?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Right, and then from there I think I milled around a little bit
and said, “Hello,” to the newsmen I recognized from the day before on the
third floor and all the available spots were taken over here at this corner
which were really the best spots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when you say “over here at this corner,” I am going to
put the number 2 with a circle under it and draw a line out and indicate that
you have stated that the place that I marked number 2 was the best spot, but
already taken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. By most of the photographers there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am writing in the words “Phenix says this number 2 spot
was already taken by other news <span class="locked">media”——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. “When he arrived.” Is that a correct statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, now you can go on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Then, I picked a spot just inside this rail—I was standing on
the curb—I was to the right of our live camera that was set up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that on the parking area side of the rail or the ramp
side of the rail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. The ramp side—I was standing on the curb there, leaning against
the rail, and the camera, part of the camera sticking out over the rail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, this chart does not show the rail itself except by a marked
line, but it does show two posts and I ask you if it isn’t fair to state that what
you are talking about is this position that I have here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Yes, that’s right, because I had a clear view down to the swinging
doors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s put it this way: I’m going to mark a line from two points,
one point being number three and the other point number four—that line being
the space between the two main posts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Looking at the mockup, there is a rail between those two main
posts, and that rail is equally divided into three parts, by two vertical posters,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If we call one of the vertical posters point number five and the
other one point number six, then as I understand your testimony you were on
the ramp side rather than the parking area side of the rail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you were approximately at the point by the post marked
on this chart as point number six?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am marking point number six as “position of Phenix at the
time of shooting.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you have testified that immediately to your left there
was a TV camera belonging to the same station as your own?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I’m going to mark without any attempt to do it in scale by
a square which I am marking “Square A” and drawing a line out to indicate
position of KRLD TV camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. You might say live camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Live camera—and that camera was just to your left and a bit
back of you, because it was on the other side of the rail, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Yes; the camera itself was behind me, the lens stuck out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Over the rail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There was another live camera in that area too, wasn’t there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Right—it was to the left of ours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, again without attempting to draw this to scale, I will draw
a rectangular figure, marking it “B” and state that that was the position
of the other TV camera.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. I am not sure whose that was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was another live camera, but not a KRLD?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, your testimony is that as to the live camera
which we have marked by rectangle with a “B” in the middle of that rectangle,
you know it was a live camera and it was not a KRLD camera, but you don’t
know whose camera it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Right—this might be incidental—I either laid the camera down
or had one of our production crew that was with the live camera hold it and
I swung my mike over the overhead pipes in this area—it’s really not important,
but that’s part of the milling around I was doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I gather what you wanted to do was to get your mike in a
position to catch sound if it was possible to do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Yes; right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, from your position six on this Exhibit 5330, you slung, shall
we say, or <span class="locked">hung——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Hung.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your wires with the live mike, the end of it, so that it would hang
down, I suppose, just as you indicated—just roughly at the position we originally
marked number 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which is where you physically were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that now position No. 1 has two meanings—it is the position
you first came to and the position where your mike was hanging.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us something of the number of people to your
right and in the ramp going towards Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. It’s a little hard to say—that camera that I was using was such
that the eyepiece is on the left and I normally keep it in a ready position on my
shoulder so it blocks my vision to the right, but there were maybe 10 or 15 people
milling around there—some were news commentators and some were radio
men with tape <span class="locked">recorders——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Some policemen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Some policemen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you judge there were 18 to 20 people along in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. It could be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By the way, how long were you in that position No. 6 prior
to the time of the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Probably at least an hour—I just didn’t want to leave it, and
we didn’t know at what exact time he was coming down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the condition of the people and the numbers
thereof to your left from position No. 6?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Well, there were many more—as we got ready to bring Oswald
out, policemen lined this wall here and formed a line coming out of the swinging
doors, and then the newsmen were back at position two mainly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Suppose we mark a line and we will call that line—let’s say
starting at No. 7 in a circle, and moving and turning towards Commerce Street
to point 8, roughly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, that curving line, which is line 7 to 8 is where police were
lined, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there police lined elsewhere?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. I believe part of this line coming down the other side were
policemen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, if we mark a line now, calling it one point of
the line nine, and the other <span class="locked">one——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. It went straight down this way [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Straight into you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which side of you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. To my right—a little bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, we mark a line from 9 to 10, with point 10 being immediately
to the right of point 6 where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, you say there were policemen along in that line too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Yes; police and press.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, take it from there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Well, from there I waited until—I believe it was a United Press
International movie photographer, Isidore, or something, everybody called him
Izzie—I don’t know his last name, came running down from the swinging doors,
I think he was the one, and said, “He’s coming,” meaning Oswald, so we all got
ready, and the camera has an <span class="locked">eyepiece——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Right; that operates through a prism that looks directly through
the lens, so I had to have my eyes stuck against the eyepiece in order to see
through it. So, from then on, all I saw was Oswald coming down the hallway
there, and I didn’t actually—I wasn’t aware of seeing Ruby step out of the
crowd—I knew something had happened and the shot—at the shot somebody
came roaring in from my left and almost knocked me down. The unipod was
braced on the curb and it slipped down to the main level of the ramp and almost
fell, and looking through the eyepiece and over the eyepiece, too, just shooting
out of habit really, the camera was running all the time—I followed the action
of the policeman wrestling with Ruby—it just happened that they moved to
my right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your film, as a matter of fact, is that famous film that catches
Ruby moving forward and the wrestling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Right; I just saw it once and we were so busy, but I think it
was the one where Ruby’s hat was in the corner of the opening frame and he
steps out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have seen it since, haven’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you observed him in the crowd prior to these events?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. I can’t remember it. I heard someone say in the crowd after
they took Ruby and after Oswald left in the ambulance that it was Jack Ruby,
and the name didn’t mean a thing to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear anybody running down the ramp just before the
shooting, running down or possibly walking down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. No, I think if he had been running I would have heard him
because the sound just echoes in that basement.</p>

<p>I saw some film, and I’m sure you’ve seen it too, some of the film that showed
Ruby positioned down there, and he looks back where you catch almost a full
shot of his face before Oswald comes down, and that anyway—it just looks
like he was there for a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear Ruby say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. No; maybe in the excitement I heard him, but I don’t remember
hearing this famous quotation about “Jack, you S. O. B.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t hear anybody; hear anything, including Ruby—anything
distinguishable that you now remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. The only one I can remember is Bob Huffaker, who is the mike
man for our live camera, saying over and over that “He’s been shot,” and he
was calling him “Lee Harold Oswald.” I don’t know why—and then just in
general—a few words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You heard him saying, “He’s been shot, he’s been shot, he’s
been shot,” a number of times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Yes, and the policemen telling everybody to stand back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the security precautions that were in existence,
and would you comment about those as far as you observed them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Well, as we drove in there were several officers down there, but
nobody made any effort, you know, to talk to us as we drove in—we were in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
the car that had big KRLD letters on it and Wes Wise was known to some
of them, but I wasn’t; Wes was driving the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There was a guard there that seemed to look you over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Now, I don’t remember a guard on the Main Street side as we
drove in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, that was at 9 o’clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Right, and later, I think there was a lieutenant from the Dallas
Police Force just walking through the crowds, and I could tell he was looking
me over, and stood there about 3 or 4 feet from me a little bit and never said
anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know any of the people from WBAP-TV in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. I know some of their camera men—the reporter-camera men—is
that Channel 5?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t know. Do you know Tankersley, a Mr. Tankersley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. I think I know who he is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Mr. Timmons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Jim Turner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you observe during the time you were standing at your
position No. 6, a camera being loaded through the double doors or swinging
doors at the jail corridor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Yes; there was a live camera also—I don’t know whose that was
and I don’t even know where the camera wound up—the final position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you observe how many people were pushing it along?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. I didn’t really pay any attention to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know even now whose camera it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. It was either NBC or ABC—it was a local camera man but they
were shooting for one of those two networks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long before the shooting was it that you saw this camera
being rolled out from the jail corridor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Not—it wasn’t too long before the shooting—maybe 20 minutes.
We were getting a little edgy from sitting there so long, so it’s hard to estimate
time, or, I was getting edgy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you notice a police car come from the parking area up the
ramp that goes from the parking area to the level of the basement area and
turn right, pass you, and go on up the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. You mean come out from here and go out this way? [Indicating
on markup.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; that’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. I can’t remember, really. I may have and I may not—I just
really can’t remember. I know there was—I believe there was a paddy wagon
that came through earlier. It seems like I remember a car, though, driving out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Phenix, have you ever been interviewed before by any
member of the Commission’s Staff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And actually, you were not interviewed by me before this deposition
began?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it fair to state that anyone reading the two reports or statements
that you have given, identified as Exhibits 5328 and 5329, and following
your deposition today, with the chart that has been identified as Exhibit 5330,
would have the whole story, as far as you know anything about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Yes; but I would like to say that I believe it is in Exhibit 5329
that I said that no other newsmen were asked for their identification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Now, that’s just as far as I know—I didn’t actually see—I
couldn’t say that absolutely no one was asked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right—that’s all right—you are telling me that is a possibility?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All you can say is what you observed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And from your observation, you didn’t see anybody else being
asked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there anything else you would like to say about this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. No; that’s all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you very much. We appreciate your coming up here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phenix</span>. All right.</p>

<h2 id="TURNER">TESTIMONY OF JIMMY TURNER</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of Jimmy Turner was taken at 9:45 a.m., on March 25, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President’s
Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, this is the deposition of Mr. James Turner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Jimmy Turner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Jimmy Turner. Fort Worth, Tex. Mr. Turner, my name is Leon
D. Hubert, I am a member of the advisory staff of the General Counsel of the
President’s Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy. Under
the provisions of the President’s Executive Order No. 11130, dated November
29, 1963, the Joint Resolution of Congress No. 137 and rules of civil procedure
adopted by the Commission in conference with the Executive order and the
joint resolution, I have been authorized to take a sworn deposition from you,
Mr. Turner.</p>

<p>I state to you that the general nature of the Commission’s inquiry is to
ascertain, evaluate and report upon the facts relating to the assassination
of President Kennedy and to the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey
Oswald. In particular to you, Mr. Turner, the nature of the inquiry today
is to determine what perhaps you know about the death of Oswald and any
other pertinent facts you may know about the general inquiry. Now, I think
you have appeared here today as the result of the receipt of a letter from
Mr. Rankin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you get that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. It arrived last Monday, which was the 22d of March.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, under the rules of the Commission, you are entitled to
a 3-day notice prior to the taking of this deposition. That probably dates from
the day the letter was sent, which would be over 3 days, but just to be certain,
the rules also provide that you can waive the 3 days on this if you want to.
Are you willing to testify now, or do you want to wait until the 3 days have
passed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Well, I might as well, now that I am here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you do waive the 3-day notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I certainly do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then will you stand and raise your right hand and be sworn.
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you please state your name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Jimmy Turner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The name “Jimmy,” is your correct name? It is not “James”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you reside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. 3637 Norma Street in Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your age, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I am 38, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your employment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I am TV director at WBAP-TV at Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been so employed?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Twelve and a half years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you assigned to the visit of the President to Dallas, and
to the subsequent events?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I was assigned after the assassination to NBC. I arrived over
here approximately 1:15 the day of the assassination, which was November 22,
and I remained over here until—through the following Wednesday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, did you have access during that period to the jail building
on Harwood, between Commerce and Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was a particular sort of pass or identification given to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No; it was not a pass given to us. No identification was ever
required. The identification I used was a press card from a Sheraton Hotel,
and I was never checked about the authenticity of it or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you were asked, in any case, to show that press pass that
you have just described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes; we were. We were wearing it on our coat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you describe that again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. It was a press pass that the Sheraton Dallas Hotel had when
they opened the new hotel here in Dallas. It had “Press” on it, the seal of
the Sheraton Hotel and my name after it. It was very vague but the only
thing we had at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you ever accosted by anyone with respect to checking as
to whether <span class="locked">you——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were connected with news media?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You felt that simply wearing this on your coat with the word,
“Press,” was sufficient to get around as you wanted to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see them checking any other people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. To my knowledge, up until the following morning after the
shooting of Oswald, there was no checking of passes that we ran into. Now,
there was a checking after the shooting when we left the building, but I left
the building with the pass, and came back in the building with the pass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am sure that during the 48 hours, approximately, between the
President’s death and the shooting of Oswald, that you must have had occasion
to go in and out of that building a number of times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I used it at Parkland Hospital. I used it at the city hall
also without being stopped, or asked what kind of pass it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Prior to November 24, did you know that man now known as
Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No; I didn’t, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had never seen him before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I had never seen him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you ever heard of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I had never heard of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, of course, since November 24, you have heard of Jack
Ruby. You have seen his picture, I take it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever seen him in person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir; I saw him at the trial. At various times when they
took him in the courtroom, except the morning of the shooting I saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You saw him then, too? What I wanted to get at was whether
you ever saw the man now known as Jack Ruby, in the police building prior to
the time that you saw him immediately before the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. To my knowledge, I had never seen him until then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have occasion to go to the assembly on the night of
Friday, November 22, at which time Oswald was brought into the assembly
room, or lineup room, I think it is in the police building, and as Oswald was
shown, I think, by the district attorney to the various reporters who were
assembled there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir; we didn’t arrive over until 1 a.m., Saturday morning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
prior to the shooting, so we did not have access to the lineup room that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, on the morning of the 24th, would you tell us what your
activities were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Well, we—I am not sure on the exact time we arrived. I
think it was around 7:30, from Fort Worth. We set up our cameras down
in the basement. We had one on the third floor and one camera on the truck,
on the outside exit way from the jail. The driveway on the Commerce Street
side of the jail. We set our cameras up right across from the door in the
hallway where they bring the prisoners out to transfer them, or Oswald out,
which—and that little hallway is very narrow. Do you have a plan there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just a moment.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am marking a document as follows to wit: “Dallas, Tex.,
March 25, 1954. Exhibit 5080, Deposition of Jimmy Turner,” and signing
it with my name and asking Mr. Turner to sign his name below that. Now,
Mr. Turner, using the chart which we have marked now as Exhibit 5080,
would you, sir, tell us of your activities on the morning of November 24, using
a sequence of numbers placed in a circle as to each stopping point, or object
that you testify about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. All right. Now, getting back, we had first placed the camera in
“1”, where I will mark “1” on this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In the circle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. In a circle. Now, this is a camera position. Can I make it
a box? We’ll keep the camera as a box and the circles as people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s correct, but in each case put a numeral.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Numeral.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In the circle, or box, and use the numerals in sequence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. “No. 1,” would be our camera in our original position before
Chief Curry came down and talked to us about not having it in that position.
We <span class="locked">had——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Oh, it was approximately 9 to 10, that’s all I can say. I have
no recollection of the time. All right, and in position No. “1,” we had stationed
our camera. Chief Curry came out in a period of 9 to 10 and said, “Boys, you
can’t leave the camera there. It’s going to be in the way when they bring him
out the door. Now, I want all you boys to get a clean shot of it, so, I will get
the cars moved out across the railing.” So, we’ll number the rail “2.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes. Put that in the circles, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. All right. No. “2” position here [indicating]. “We’ll move the
cars out from that location and you can set your cameras there, and I will assure
you that you will have a clean shot of the whole thing,” meaning that we
would have a good angle on him coming out of the jail, and everything, so, we
immediately rerun our camera cables across the driveway up above, hung them
up in the air conditioning, which is position “3,” across—can I keep this “3” all
the way through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. And, sir, we ran our camera cables back along the route of No.
“3.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me interrupt you for a moment. Prior to this move, your
camera cables came down on the Harwood Street side of the ramp leading to
the Commerce <span class="locked">Street——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. In other words—I do not recognize this line here [indicating],
this line—this ramp—oh, this is the building. Oh, this is the building overhang.
Now, I know what that is. This is the complete building that covers it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when you phoned that your cameras would have to be across
the ramp, you ran into the problem of your cables?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And, as I understanding your testimony you solved the problem
by placing your cables on the Harwood Street side of that ramp leading to the
Commerce Street up until the point “3” that you marked, after you—after which
you strung them <span class="locked">over——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. It may have been back in here [indicating]. I don’t think they
came completely to this point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case, you strung them <span class="locked">over——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Over the drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Over this drive so that automobiles passing wouldn’t pass over
the cables?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then you dropped them down the opposite side from where they
had been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No; we stayed up in the ceiling with them. That’s right. We
had to stay up in the ceiling because any cars running over the cables—running
over them knocked them out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you strung them along the roof and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, now, where did that camera ultimately come to rest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. From position “1” here, which is marked “1” on this. We moved
it to—from—I am now marking “4,” in a box and that is our position that we
moved it to from where we had our position at one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, you were—that camera was left, and remained
<span class="locked">left——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right, sir, it remained left. Slang [phonetic], the director,
took it. We had two other cameras working.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. One was up on the third floor of the city jail, around the hallway
elevator shaft, and another camera was on top of a remote truck which was
parked on Commerce Street on top the remote truck, to pick up when they
made the exit with Oswald. We were trying to think ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were told then that there would be an <span class="locked">exit——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No; they didn’t—they didn’t say where the exit would be. We
never knew that. We were just guessing at that point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. We were never told that they were coming out the Commerce
Street entrance. We just assumed, since it was the entrance to the jail, he
would come out that way, so, we positioned the camera on top of the remote
truck to pick up if he did come out that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why didn’t you make your preparation for an exit from the
Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. We had only three cameras, and from all—the way that all the
cars had been coming out of the jail, they had been coming out the Commerce
Street exit. We hadn’t given any idea that they would reverse and go out
through the Main Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it normally that Main Street is the entrance and Commerce is
the exit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right, so that gave us our idea that he would be brought
out that way, and we would get a shot of him leaving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. You might do this for us now using that numeral
system. Place in boxes the other cameras, TV cameras of other radio stations,
if you know where they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. All right. Then “5” will become a camera for CBS.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What local station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. KRLD. And they were in position, too, along this rail with us.
I think at first they were up here with us. This is very vague. They were
hanging the camera up on the other side, which is position—well, I won’t position
that one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But they ultimately had to move down where you were? They
were on your right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. They were on our right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there any other cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. There was only two live television cameras in the basement at
that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Approximately 10 minutes—very vague on time—when the activity
had been completed on the third floor of the jail, we broke a No. “2”
camera down, which I will number “6,” entering the door. It came down the
elevator. It was completely on the tripod.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It came down over here? Not the jail elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Not the jail elevator, we never had access to that room, the jail
office here. It came down, and as it was entering the two double doors I left
my camera in position, which is box “4,” it came over the rails. Let me number
this up too. “6” would be our camera coming from the third floor. I immediately
left my camera position when I saw them entering, to help get the camera
down, and relieve one of the boys which could—which he could go up and get
the camera cables to connect his camera up to make it live.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when that camera became—when that camera began to
come through the swinging door in the jail corridor, how many men were
pushing it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Two men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Dave Timmons and John Tankersley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have to go over and assist them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. After they had come from the door, I ran off my—ran off from
my position of “4,” to position “6,” after they came to the door, and helped them
to move the camera to where we are <span class="locked">putting——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Before you do <span class="locked">that——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where were you in relation to Tankersley and Timmons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. You mean in pushing the camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I came, as you look toward the camera, I came up to the left side
of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was in the middle? You were on one end?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I’m not sure. I think Mr. Tankersley was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then Timmons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Timmons was on the other side. Usually the cameraman who
is doing the camera work has hold of the center of the camera and whoever
helps him will help on the side of the dolly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you are the third man then on that camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. All right. We moved from position No. “6” here, which I have
labeled “6”, down to where I have now labeled “7”.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are making a box there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Box. Right. Box for “7”.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did that camera ever get into operation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, it never did, sir; because by the time we got it to “7”, they
had completely blocked the doors. I think someone said that it was—they were
bringing him down and that we couldn’t leave it out there at that point or
something. This is very vague.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, in any case, the thing never got in operation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The second camera never got in operation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right. The second camera hadn’t gotten into operation.
I then—when I found out they couldn’t go back I returned to my position, which
is on box “4”, and Mr. Tom Pettit of NBC was at circle number “7”, which was
our newsman from NBC. He was hollering to me, “Tell them in New York to
give it to me.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say that you would go live on the national?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right. We’d go live on the national network. So, I was
talking on the direct line to him. The police car left out sometime in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
excitement, going up the exit the wrong way. I mean the entrance the wrong
way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Going up towards Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right, which was different from the one, because we had
always seen them come down it, and that was the first time we noticed them
going out of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did that car have any difficulty going up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Come to think of it, I think he did. I remember a lot of wheels
spinning or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there many people there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. There was quite a few. The reporters had come in at that point,
somewhere along in that point, and there was getting to be a group of people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Anyway, what you are saying is, that the movement of that car
attracted your attention, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. There was some brakes squealing or tires spinning at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you follow with your eyes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I followed him as far as I could, now, there was some more
commotion started a little before that of them bringing a truck in, backing an
armored truck in from the exit side of it, which they were having a difficult
job of getting this truck in. Now, this all happened—I can’t tell you the exact
time, because it is all vague in my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s go back to the police car going up the Main Street ramp
towards Main Street, did you follow it with your eyes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I followed it not only to about a point to where the drive had
started up, because it was <span class="locked">impossible——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To the point where the ramp starts to go up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Uphill, the slope up, which was this column here had sort of
blocked our view <span class="locked">from——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mark the column with a number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That is number “9”.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With a circle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. And, I was standing up at the front of point “4”, on the left
side of the camera, which was right next to the column. Jack Beers from the
Dallas Morning News, who took the picture before he was shot—not the picture
after he shot him, was immediately—I was touching him with my left arm, and
I had mentioned to Jack, I said, “Jack, when I swing around for them to load
him into the truck up there, well, I’ll hit you on the knee, if—and would you get
out of the way?”</p>

<p>And Jack said, “Yes.” So—this all took place so quick from now on. And
then after I got through talking with Jack, I was—Tom was trying to attract my
attention. I happened to glance up and this was at the same time the car drove
out of the—I’m not sure. I couldn’t—that right down where the ramp it hit—the——</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Level part?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Level part. I saw Mr. Ruby coming in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, had you ever seen him before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir; I certainly hadn’t. Let me mark “10” as the point
where I actually saw Mr. Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, in order to get it right, would you look at the mockup
first, and then place it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I was right here [indicating], and he was somewhere in this
locality when—it is beyond the second column.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you mark a line, and mark it “A” and “B” straight across
at the beginning on the right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you have marked a line, having compared it with the
mockup, and you have marked it “A-B”.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That is the beginning of <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of the rise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right. I might be a little off there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you say you saw Jack Ruby. You had not known him to be
Jack Ruby at that time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No; what set him off from other men was the hat he was wearing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What sort of hat was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I don’t know the technical name. Could you help me out? It
was a felt hat, had a pretty large brim on it, and it was a—round on top, which
you seldom see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Snap brim?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No; it wasn’t snap brim. It was just a wide brim, and like you
say, I didn’t go that far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what color it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. It seemed to be grey.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you describe any other clothing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes; he was, to my knowledge he was dressed in an overcoat,
or long—it could have been a suit coat, but I didn’t notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have a fair look at his face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. At an angle that I do not recognize him now. He seemed to be
much heavier then than when I saw him in the Ruby trial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you mark the position where you saw this man, marking it
with the next number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. All right. Let’s see. “10.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think that that man that you saw at position “10”, was
Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I certainly do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was coming down the Main Street ramp at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was moving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. He was moving at that time but this man looks like Ruby, but he
seemed to be heavier than I see him now. I don’t know whether it is an allusion,
being in a dark <span class="locked">place——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see a man come out from the crowd and shoot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that man the same man that you <span class="locked">have——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. It was this same man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That you have marked as “10”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. As “10”. It was the same man, and came out and shot him
from “10”.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, that if it were Jack Ruby who shot Oswald, it was Jack
Ruby at place number “10”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right. Right. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long before the shooting was it that you saw a man in position
number “10” there in a circle on the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. It was not more than 15 to 30 seconds. It <span class="locked">was——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you keep your eye on the man, this man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No; I had just glanced up there, and I had come back—my eye on
our reporter, Tom Pettit, and also the door, which is behind Tom Pettit, which I
will mark right now as “11”, where Oswald made his exit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when was the next time you saw the man whom you have
previously identified as number “10” and at what position was he then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. The next time I saw him he walked up to Position “12”, which
was almost in line with our man, Pettit, which is number “8”, here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you saw him then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he at the front row of those people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Let me mark two more positions here, sir. A policeman was
over here to his right, I think, which we’ll mark, “13”, and then there was a
reporter, or a man dressed in a suit, I’ll call him the reporter at “14”.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, and my point is, that when you next saw the man who
is now identified as Jack Ruby, and therefore I shall refer to him as Jack Ruby
from now on out, he was at a position marked as number “12”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he standing still there, or moving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. There was only a matter of 4 seconds, or 5 seconds, when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
arrived there that—until Oswald reached the point where he was assassinated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You saw Ruby arrive at the front?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right. He walked up to—see, this is all in line, from our
camera position to our—there were—they were just a little back of the side
light from our camera to our <span class="locked">newscaster——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s number “8”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you are willing to say that he was standing at the front
row of the group of people congregated there for possibly 5 seconds before he
moved forward to shoot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right, that’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you judge that the time that you saw him standing still,
5 seconds before this shooting of Oswald, was approximately 15 to 20 seconds
after you first saw him in that position “10”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I am vague about that time. Ten seconds or 20 seconds. I am
very vague. I mean, but I know he was only there a short time, because I saw—we
were on guard to try to move the newsmen out of our way, push them out of
the way in front of the camera, and you kind of thrash around at the movement
of them to keep on your shot, and that is how I come to notice another man
up there. These three men are the only ones that I remember on that side except
our man Pettit. There could have been more. There was some CBS cameramen
over in this locality, but they had already been there, and that wasn’t in my
mind at all, the ones that were actually stationed there. It was the movement
of people at that time that made you look at it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, let’s get a little bit more about this period for Jack
Ruby to move from the position you have marked “10”, to the position you
have marked “12”, when he was standing in the front line. Did he have to go
through any great mass of people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, not to my knowledge, because I didn’t see a great number of
men up in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have to push, or shoulder his way up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He could just walk up and get into that position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right. There was some more men out there in this area,
but I can’t connect it at this point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I want to get at, from what you tell me the group was
not such that he would have to bulldoze his way through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No; he just flat walked up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just once, again for the record. There can be no doubt in your
mind but the man now identified as Jack Ruby is the man you saw at position
“10”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; now, during our interview, immediately preceding the
commencement of this deposition you mentioned another person that you had
seen around the court building on several occasions, and I should like now—in
other words, tell what you know about this person when you first saw him,
now, at the numerous occasions on which you saw him until the last time that
you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. All right. All right. We arrived from Fort Bliss at approximately
1 a.m. Saturday, the 23d of November, from Fort Worth, to set up our
mobile unit inside the jail for a coverage of the assassination of the President,
and when we arrived there we—there was this man that resembled John
Carradine of the movies quite a lot. He was very thin faced, around 40 to 50,
carrying a portfolio, and another little bag with him. Looked like a shaving
kit bag, or something of that effect. He—as soon as we got there, it was chilly,
and we went inside the open doors on the Commerce Street side, and he was
standing inside, and he immediately started talking to us about various things
which we passed off as just an average person talking to you, finding out what
you were doing and everything, and he talked to us about 15 or 20 minutes.
He did mention in his conversation that he had been a school teacher prior to
that, about 16 months before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, did he have a press badge on?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, he had no badge on. He was wearing a light trenchcoat or
topcoat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What height was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. He was approximately 5 feet 8 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What would you guess his weight to be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Oh, only around 130 to 140 pounds. Very light in weight; very
skinny.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see the clothing he had under the trenchcoat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No; as far as I know, I never saw him without the trenchcoat
on, the whole time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. He—We went to the cafe down the block to grab a bite to eat
at this time, waiting on the truck, and the truck arrived while we were eating,
and when we got back there he was still standing there talking, and a Mexican
gentleman had come out, had been drinking too heavy, and made some comment
about that, just a general line of talk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ever mention his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. He never mentioned his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear anyone else talk to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. As long as I was over there the only ones I saw talk to him
was the man, Dave Timmons, with our crew, which was up there at the time,
and Richard Bice, he was there, which was with the crew, and that is the only
ones I ever saw him talk to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see him talk to any policemen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Never did, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. He continually, after they got set up, he kept coming up in
the hallway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is on the third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. On the third floor, sir. This is while we were still up on the
third floor, and waiting to get shots of Oswald being transferred from the elevator
door to the questioning room, and he would continually come up and
give—say, “They are going to bring him down in about 5 minutes.” And he
usually was right, on each one of the tips he gave us. He mingled around in
the press room up on the third floor a lot. He—I told Tom Pettit, which was the
announcer up on the floor, that Oswald was coming down, and he said, “Where
are you learning the information?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You asked this of this man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Well, no; I didn’t ever ask him where he was learning his information,
but I told—Tom Pettit asked me where I was getting this information,
and I said, “Well, that man back over there,” and I pointed him out and he
said, “Who is he?” And I said, “I don’t know who he is, but he is giving us
some pretty good tips.” And he said, “Okay, keep using him, then.” From
that point on, we saw him various times the whole, completely on the third.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many times do you think you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Oh, any number of times, 15 or 20. Just pass him in the hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he seem to have free movement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right. He had free movement on that floor. He had free
movement in the basement. That was the only two floors we actually ever did
see him, but he was on those floors, back to the press room, talking to the other
reporters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. And, he—and then Sunday morning we came over. I ran into
him in the restroom, and he seemed to just live there in the jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Still had that trenchcoat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. And still carrying the little bag, same little bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did it seem to be a camera bag?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No; they were not camera bags. One little, thin portfolio, and
I took the assumption he was selling insurance, from just looking at the little—something
like an insuranceman might show to a customer, but that could be
entirely wrong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then he had another bag besides that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right. Something like a traveling kit. Somewhere about
2 inches deep. And we came again Sunday morning, and then we went through
the shooting of Oswald, he wasn’t in the basement, to my knowledge at this
point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you see him next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. The next time I saw him was approximately 15 minutes after
the shooting when I started to our remote truck to pick up a mike line and
a camera cable. The doors was being guarded by policemen, who stopped me,
and I told them my business; why I wanted to leave the jail, and give them
my name and he let me leave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was at the Commerce Street entrance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Commerce Street entrance. All right, and when I came back
in, which was approximately 3 or 4 minutes after, after we got the stuff ready
to bring the camera in to take the lineup room, which is in the basement of
the jail, well, this officer had him at the door, and he was trying to show him
identification from his billfold.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know who that officer was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir; I don’t. And this man turned to me and said, “That
man there can identify me,” and I said, “Like hell I can. I don’t know who
you are or what you are.” Or similar to this effect, that I had seen the
man, but I didn’t know who he was, so, I kept on about my business, because
we were pretty rushed at that time, and approximately 15 minutes later I
ran onto him in the hallway coming back out the same door, and he said,
“Thanks a million,” and I said, “Well, I don’t know you from anyone.” I
said, “That’s why I didn’t identify you.” Or something to that effect and
from that point on, I have never seen the gentleman again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you made any effort to ascertain who he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I have reported this to the Secret Service, Mr. Carter with
the Secret Service, and I figured it wasn’t any of my business, from that
point on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have never seen him since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were at the Ruby trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never saw that man there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know most of the officers of the—top officers, at least—of
the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I know several. The chief and several of them, by face. I do
not know them personally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, in any case, as far as you know, this man that you have
described looks like John Carradine, with the other aspects of the description
you have given, wasn’t a police officer that you knew to be a police officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right, sir—as far as I know. I never saw him talking
to a police officer or any of them except the one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He wasn’t at the Ruby trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. He was never at the Ruby trial. The one officer at the door
was the only contact I ever saw him with a police officer, and that was when
he was, to my knowledge, trying <span class="locked">to——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You remember any other facial characteristics about him, for
instance, the color of his hair, or the way he wore his hair, or did he need
a haircut, or was <span class="locked">he——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. He was a typical man. I didn’t pay much attention to the
haircut, but I’m pretty sure it was dark hair, black hair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have any scars, or identifiable marks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. He did not have scars, but just wrinkles of age, like Carradine
does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old a man would he have been, do you think?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Between 40 and 50, is my guess, but he had some wrinkles on
his face. He was thin-jawed like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What color eyes?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I don’t know. I didn’t get that far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he wore this trenchcoat all the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And carried the two bags?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right, and he was walking around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have any sort of accent in his speech?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No; he had a typical Texan speech. I mean like myself, I
have one, and he talked like a Texan. He didn’t <span class="locked">have——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Didn’t have any foreign accent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. And, he did mention he had been a schoolteacher.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I want to go back for a minute to this matter of the position
of Ruby of which you have marked on Exhibit 5080, at position “10.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On the line, “A,” “B,” now, which shows him at position “10,” he
was moving, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right, he was slowly moving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And his movement was from what direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. He was going forward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, he was coming from what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. From down the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there any possibility that his movement could have been
through the rail at this point that I am marking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right, because it is—here is my <span class="locked">opinion——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At a <span class="locked">point——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Let’s see. “11,” “12,” “14,” “15.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s say approximately “15,” by the rail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. He could have come over the rail, because I didn’t see him prior
to that point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, his movements were such that you couldn’t say
whether he came down the ramp, or came through the rail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right, sir, because I didn’t see him far enough up the
ramp to where it was enclosed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And when you did see him it was beyond the point where the rail
begins?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I think I am too far back according to this. He would have—let’s
move “A,” “B,”——</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, let’s put the second position that you have mentioned as
“C,” “D.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. According to your mockup, it is half way, approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. All right, I am a <span class="locked">little——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s mark that “C,” “D,” so that now on second thought about
it and looking at the mockup again, you want to have your previous testimony
adjusted so that where you referred to Ruby at position “10,” on line “A,” “B,”
previously, you now think it was that he was on position “10,” at line “C,”
“D”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you do that because you place him at the point where the
ramp begins to go up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, using this scale, which appears on the mockup, I would
ask you to verify this with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That the incline begins almost exactly 13 <span class="locked">feet——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Beyond the rail, I mean where the start of the rail is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thirteen feet from the start of the rail on the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right, sir, this would be our location here where he <span class="locked">eventually——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Therefore, am I correct in saying there was approximately 13
feet of rail through which Ruby could have come prior to the time you saw
him at position number “10”?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. You are correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, going back to that position number “10” on the line, “C,”
“D”. You have placed position number “10” almost in the middle of the ramp.
Was he closer to one side or to the other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. He seemed to be closer and—this is hard to say, because it was
almost a casual glance, that he was closer to the rail side than he was to the
other side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not see him come over the rail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir; I did not. I did not come in contact with the man
until he was in the position—he was nearly in the center of it when I came
in contact, and the man—the hat was the most obvious facial—I mean just
glancing at a man you take something that you can pick a man out by and
remember his name by it. That is the way I remember people is something they
ordinarily wear, and he had the hat on, but I thought he was a—much larger
than—by just glancing at him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We’ll come back to the other point. Is there any doubt in your
mind that the man that you saw, however you would identify him at point
number “10,” was the man that you later saw step forward and shoot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir; and without a doubt in my mind, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you anything else you would like to say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, I want to say that I hope I have been some help to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, let me ask you this: Other than myself, have you been interviewed
by any other member of the Commission staff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Not on the Commission staff, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, there was a little preliminary interview between you
and me this morning before your deposition went onto the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you perceive any inconsistencies between our colloquy in
the interview prior to the beginning of the actual taking of this deposition and
the matters covered in the deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir; none at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, did you tell me anything during the interview which we have
not covered in the deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. You mean before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, we discussed everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We got it all in the deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I certainly thank you very much, sir.</p>

<h2 id="FUQUA">TESTIMONY OF HAROLD R. FUQUA</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of Harold R. Fuqua was taken at 3:55 p.m., on April 1, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President’s
Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is a deposition of Harold Fuqua [spelling] F-u-q-u-a. Mr.
Fuqua, my name is Leon Hubert. I am a member of the advisory staff of
the General Counsel of the President’s Commission. Under the provisions
of the Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, Joint Resolution of
Congress No. 137, and the rules of procedure adopted by the Commission in
conformance with that Executive order and joint resolution, I have been
authorized to take a sworn deposition from you. I state to you now that
the general nature of the Commission’s inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate, and
report upon the facts relating to the assassination of President Kennedy and
the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald. In particular, as to you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
Mr. Fuqua, the nature of the inquiry today is to determine what facts you know
about the death of Oswald and any other pertinent facts you may know about
the general inquiry.</p>

<p>Now, I think, Mr. Fuqua, that you have appeared here today by—as a result
of an informal request made to the Dallas Public Works Department for whom
you work, and I wish to advise you that under the rules of the Commission
you would normally be entitled to a 3-day written notice before the taking
of this deposition, but the rules of the Commission also provide that a witness
may waive that 3-day notice if he wishes to do so, and I ask you now if you
are willing to have your deposition taken now and therefore willing to waive
the 3-day written notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. I’m ready now, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Will you stand and raise your right hand. Do you
solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you state your full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Harold Rogers Fuqua.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Thirty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And where do you live, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. 4338 Penelope, Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Parking attendant, basement of city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Parking attendant in the basement of the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been so employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. By the city of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. About 6 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, were you on duty on the morning of November 24, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say you were on duty, that means you were on duty
in the parking area of the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That basement is partially under the city hall, and partially
under the police building, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. No, sir; it is under the municipal part of it. The parking basement,
because it is right beside the jail part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, the parking area in the basement is really
under the municipal building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. That is the way I would think of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And, what—it is all connected up by the two ramps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That go up to Main Street and Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Also a sort of a corridor that goes into the jail office, isn’t that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your duties, normally, are just to assist in parking of cars down
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Right, and make sure that the right people—in other words,
we have people that come down each day to maybe want to park and go get
a prisoner out of jail or pay their water bill. We don’t permit that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, that parking area is used for employees of the
city and the municipal building, as well as for police automobiles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just not a public parking lot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that is your job, to keep them from parking down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Yes; and to assist, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And to assist getting cars out when people come for them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, on the morning of November 24, do you recall being put
out of the basement area, I guess you might call it, along with Alfreadia Riggs
and others?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. You said tell you what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; tell us what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. All right, we were standing along and watching on, and then
we went back and sit down over there, you know, at the telephone down where
the elevator goes up into the municipal building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the service elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Right, and captain and sergeant came over and said—well, said,
“I hate to run you off your job”—said, “—but we’d rather for nobody but
news reporters and police officers be down here.” At that time they were
making a search through the basement there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time was that about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. About 9:30, somewhere about like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then what happened next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. We all loaded on the elevator and went up to the first floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go up with Mr. Pierce or did you come up a little later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Seemed to me that we all went up together, or maybe I went
up—I don’t know. I know that he made a trip down back. It might have been
that I didn’t go up with Mr. Pierce. I <span class="locked">don’t——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And came up a little later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it much later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Not too much later, because the time the captain told me he had
rather for us to go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, you went up to the first floor of the municipal building
then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that would have been about 9:30, or a quarter of 10:00?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. About 9:30, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. We all were watching the action that was going on out on
Commerce Street side and there was a lot of people standing out on the sidewalk
with a—those officers were trying to keep them on the far side of the street,
on the south side of the street rather than the north side, and when anybody
would pass along there to try to maybe enter the building, they would ask them
for some type—would appear to me that they would ask—were asking for some
type of credentials or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you stay there watching them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. I guess must have been stayed there—seemed like to me 30
minutes or more stayed there watching them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Riggs and I left together and said, “Let’s see if we can’t go
down and watch it on television,” see, so, we went out to the alleyway onto
Main Street and walked back, came up the street and went around there by
the ramp there, and came on around and came in from the Harwood side, and
went down through the basement to the locker room to watch it on television.
There was one fellow down there, he said that he didn’t think it would
be on television, probably reruns would be on television, so, we came back up,
and just about the time we came back up into the basement, that is—I guess
that is when we heard the shot and the scrambling. We went on, and we went
into the records building, which is right down from the jail office there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you came down in the basement, you don’t mean you
came into the ramps, or the parking area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were there by the records room then?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Yes; on around right from the Harwood side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you get out of the municipal building, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. You mean after <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; when you and Riggs left. First of all, what time was
it, about, when you left the municipal building to go out and <span class="locked">around——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Seemed to me that it must have been 10 or after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think it was as late as 11?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. No; I don’t think it was that late.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me put it another way. When you left Servance and
Pierce and the others, at the Commerce Street entrance and you and Riggs
decided to go and watch on television and you left for the municipal building,
how long was it before the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Oh, it wasn’t over 10 or 15 minutes at the most. I doubt if
it was that long, because we walked slowly along the street there and where
these two officers were on the Main Street side, and just walked on around
slowly, around the Harwood side, and looked down the ramp, and by the time
we found out it wasn’t—that it wasn’t going to be on television and came <span class="locked">back——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that is about the time the shot was fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long were you in the locker room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. I think, sir, we were long enough—I think Riggs bought a can
of chili and beans or something he bought.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he had a chance to eat it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. He just walked on back up the stairs. We was laughing, we
got to wondering what he did with the can when he got back up, because I
guess just before he finished it, well, that is what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have seen pictures of him in the papers, of course?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you were walking along Main Street there and past the
Main Street ramp, did you see him along Main Street or anywhere in the crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. No, sir. I don’t remember him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You would have passed there, you think, about 10 minutes before
the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Something about like that, about 10 minutes before the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what door did you use to get out of the municipal building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Well, see, the elevator coming—you know, the service elevator, it
has got a front and rear door, and we punched it and went through the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you punched it it opened the rear door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. That’s what happened, right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, it made like a little hallway with the elevator being the hall,
that is with the two doors of the elevator opened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Right. You go straight through, because whenever the elevator
is on the first floor lots of people want to use the elevator, they say, “Let me go
through the back door.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you got into the elevator door and the municipal
building side of the elevator was open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you punched the door on the other side of the elevator which
opened that door so that you could get to the corridor leading to the alleyway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. All the controls are on one side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, in any case, you remember that the back door to the elevator,
that is, to say, the elevator door on the alleyway side was closed, and you had
to punch a button to open it up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then how did you get out of the back door that leads to the
alleyway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Riggs opened up that door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did he get a key from? Do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Key—see, the key usually hangs up in the elevator there. It is
a string of keys on a stick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he take them with him—put it this way; did he have to use
the key to open that door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Yes; he would have to use a key.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he lock it back up again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Yes; he locked it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. You see, lots of times I do work, and I believe I remember him
shaking it, you know, shake it to see if it is locked, because it is strict to keep it
closed on weekends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you have to do to close it after you had gone through
the door and were standing in the alleyway area? How do you lock it then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. I don’t know whether you exactly—whether you can fix it so it
will lock when you pull it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or do you have to turn the key?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Right. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, you say you do remember him shaking the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After you all had passed through the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t try the door yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, from what you were able to see, he was shaking it as a
person would do just testing to see if a door is closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it seemed now to be closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I am showing you a document which purports to be a report
of an interview with you by FBI Agent Jack Peden, and I’m marking it for
identification as follows: “Dallas, Tex., April 1, 1964, Exhibit 5134, Deposition of
Harold Fuqua,” and signing my name to it. The document consists of two pages,
and I’m putting my initials on the lower right-hand corner of the second page.
Now, in order that the record may show that we are both speaking of the same
document when you testify in a moment about this document, I would like you
to place your signature near mine on the first page, and your initials near mine
on the second page, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Now, say this again, now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On that first <span class="locked">page——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Just put my first—my signature here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; just your signature. I note that you are putting your signature
above and to the right of the inscription I have put on there, that is all
right. Would you put your initials on the second page, please.</p>

<p>Now have you read that document consisting of two pages and identified as
5134?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. I have read it outside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Yes, sir; everything that I know that is on here is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you willing to state to us now that between the statement and
your deposition which you have just given that you have said all that you know
about this matter altogether?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that if the Commission takes that statement, Exhibit 5134,
and your deposition that they will have everything you know about this whole
matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir. Have you been interviewed by any member of the
Commission, to your knowledge, prior to this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there an interview between you and me prior to this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Were you the one that called me on the telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No, sir. Someone called you on the telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Yes, sir; I guess. Called me on the telephone and told me when
to be down here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; but that telephone call, whoever it was with, was solely
for the purpose of fixing the time of this appointment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No discussion of any matters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you and I have not discussed the matter before your deposition
began?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuqua</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir, I think that is all then.</p>

<p>I thank you very much.</p>

nature of the Commission’s inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate and report upon
the facts relating to the assassination of President Kennedy and the subsequent
violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald. In particular as to you, Mr. Kelly, the
nature of the inquiry today is to determine what facts you know about the
death of Oswald and any other pertinent facts you may know about the general
inquiry. Now, Mr. Kelly, you have appeared here today as a result of a request
made informally of you to come. I want to advise you that under the rules
adopted by the President’s Commission you are entitled, if you wish, to have
a 3-day written notice before this deposition can be taken. On the other hand
the Commission has also provided that if a witness doesn’t desire to have the
3-day notice and is willing to testify immediately and without having the
notice, and is willing to waive that notice that he may do so.</p>

<p>Are you willing to waive the notice and testify now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kelly</span>. Yes; I sure was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you were in the company with Harold Fuqua and Alfreadia
Riggs and that’s all of those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kelly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am showing you a document which purports to be a report of
an interview with you by FBI Agent Jack Peden, and I am marking it for

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kelly</span>. As far as I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This conveys all that you know about the matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kelly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you had any interviews with any other members of the
President’s Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kelly</span>. No, sir; besides—I mean, you know, Mr. Peden.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; he is an FBI man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kelly</span>. Well, that is the onliest one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where were you when Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kelly</span>. I was up in the—on the first floor on the Commerce exit side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kelly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see Alfreadia Riggs and Harold Fuqua there that time,
too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kelly</span>. No, sir.</p>

<h2 id="McKINZIE">TESTIMONY OF LOUIS McKINZIE</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of Louis McKinzie was taken at 9 a.m., on March 25, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President’s
Commission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. McKinzie, my name is Leon Hubert, I am a member of the
advisory staff of the general counsel of the President’s Commission on the assassination
of President Kennedy. Under the provisions of the President’s Executive
Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, a Joint Resolution of Congress, No.
137, and the rules of procedure adopted by the Commission in conformance with
an Executive order in that resolution, I have been authorized to take a sworn
deposition of you, Mr. McKinzie. I state to you now that the general nature
of the Commission’s inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate, and report upon the facts
relating to the assassination of President Kennedy and the subsequent violent
death of Lee Oswald. In particular to you, Mr. McKinzie, the nature of the
inquiry today is to determine what facts you know about the death of Oswald and
any other pertinent facts you may know about the general inquiry. Now, Mr.
McKinzie, you have appeared here today by virtue of the fact that the members of
the Secret Service contacted you to locate you and ask you to come, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have not yet received the letter addressed to you by Mr. J. Lee
Rankin, that you would be asked to come here, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see that the copy of the letter that I have was addressed to
321 Harmon Street, Dallas, Tex. That is not your address. Your address was
3321 Harmon, so, they left out one 3 there. There was also a copy of a letter
sent to the Dallas Public Works Department addressed to you that you didn’t
receive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. I didn’t receive that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me say that under the rules adopted by the Commission, you
are entitled to a 3-day written notice prior to the taking of this deposition.
As I told you, we sent out the letter with the hope that it would be received,
but apparently you have not received it. The rules, however, provide that any
witness may waive the 3-day notice if he wishes to do so. Are you willing to
waive the 3-day notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Probably, I don’t quite understand there what you mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you could, if you want to say now, “I’ll come in
when I get the letter.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. I see. I see. Well, not necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If you want to. It is just a waiving of nothing else but the
notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. In other words, since I am here, I’d just as soon not do that.
I mean, I’d just as soon answer your questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are waiving nothing else but the notice that the rules of
procedure adopted by the Commission say that you are entitled to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If you feel that you would just as soon go ahead now and not come
back 3 days after you get the letter, then you are willing to waive it, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you stand, please, and raise your right hand so that you
may be sworn? Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Please state your name for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Louis McKinzie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Fifty-four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where is your residence, Mr. McKinzie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. 3321 Harmon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Porter.</p>

Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are a city employee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been a city hall employee, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Exact—this is March and—Oh, I’d say 6 years and 6 months.
That would be just about it, correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your occupation before that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Well, I did construction work mostly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Carpenter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Carpenter’s helper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Carpenter’s helper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you been living in the Dallas area all your life?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you live before coming to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. I was raised at East Texas, Palestine, Anderson County.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Children?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Five.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All grown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. All grown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your particular job with the Dallas Public Works
Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. General porter work. I keep the first floor on the public works
department and water department and building permit department and general
split shift. I work, oh, every day, part-time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when you say general porter in the water works department,
that is the first floor of the municipal building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes; that’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I would like you to describe how you can get into the first
floor of the municipal building. All possible ways to get in the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Well, you have got—you have got a door on Main Street that
you can come in. You have got a door on Commerce Street that you can come in.
Also, have a door on the alley coming from the Western Union that you can
come in, and if somebody lets you in, well, I mean, you know it is open to the
public through the week, but weekends it is not. In other words, none of the
doors open to the public on weekends. Just working days only.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Those doors are locked on weekends, that is, Friday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s right. In other words, after 6:30 in the afternoon all
doors are locked and all elevators are canceled but one, which that is what they
call the freight elevator. It runs from the basement all the way to the fifth floor,
and that is where everybody is supposed to go in and out, through the building
at night and on weekends, Saturdays and Sundays and holidays, unless it is
maintenance men, they have their own keys.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, is there any passageway between the building known as
the jail building, or the police department building and the municipal building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. First floor, second floor and third floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. In other words, they have gates there that they close after
closing time and lock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Sort of a gate made <span class="locked">of——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Metal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Metal across metal, sort of like an accordion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it locks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. They lock that after closing time. Stay locked until 6:30, 7 the
next morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And on weekends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No; on weekends it would be locked permanently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From 6:30 Friday, in the afternoon until about 7 o’clock Monday
morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that is true of the gates, small gates on the second and
third floor, also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. First, second and third. That is the only—there is three of
them, three floors, first, second and third.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, is it possible to get into the first floor of the municipal
building from the basement by using a—the staircase, the fire escape, the fire
escape staircase?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. It is kept locked. They do have a door there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is a double door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir; they have just an ordinary door made like that one
there that you go up the stair steps from the basement, but it is locked. It is—well,
it is locked at nights, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is locked. Which side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. From the—it would be locked from the outside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From the basement side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s right. You can come out it. You can come down and
come out it, but you can’t go in it from the basement without a key.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, if a person was on the first floor, could he get to the basement
by using the fire escape stairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, the fire escape staircase doors on the first floor
of the municipal building are not locked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you can get into that fire escape staircase, as it were, and go
one flight down <span class="locked">and——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you can open the door down there, that is not locked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. It is locked, but you can open it from the inside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Okay, open from the staircase side, so, if you got into the staircase,
you could get into the basement, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes, sir; that’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, on the 24th, which was on a Sunday, the Sunday after
President Kennedy was killed, were you on duty that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes, sir; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you come on duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. 7 o’clock, Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. 3 in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what was your particular duty that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. I was running the freight elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you operate the elevator all day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you leave it at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Around 10 o’clock is when I got orders to carry it to the first
floor and cut it off and not bring any passengers down to the basement until I got
further permission from the police department, and I was off of it then, I was
still on the first floor, I just wasn’t operating it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you leave the elevator itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you leave the elevator itself and walk some place else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Just down the hallway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were the doors of the elevator open then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. It was open, but it was cut off. I had it automatic, and I had
it cut off with the key. Couldn’t <span class="locked">nobody——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, that really has two doors in it, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Back and front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the front one, I suppose, you designate as the one that
opens up into the municipal building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the back one is the one that opens up into a little hallway
that leads to an alleyway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes, sir; that’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does that back door of the elevator also open on other floors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. On the second floor of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when you left the elevator what was the position of both
doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Front was open facing the municipal building. The back was
closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It never was open at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir; never was open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall whether the back of the elevator was open any
time during the morning of November 24th, until the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. I am sure that I wouldn’t be making no mistake if I said it
was open several times, because we had some porters down there working that
brings trash from the jail department, and I always let them out that door,
and they go out the back, and that is where they keep all their trash and the
garbage and so forth, and I imagine about 8 or 8:30, that they were open, because
that is about the time they carries the trash and stuff out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that the <span class="locked">back——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. There would be one porter probably went out maybe one or
two trips.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How would he get out through that back door leading onto the
alleyway? Is that an open door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. It is locked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who has the key?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. They gives them a key to go out that door to carry the trash,
and they bring the key back and carry them back down to the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They don’t have a key personally; the key is in the elevator on
a ring, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And they have to get that key from the elevator operator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, did you give the key to anybody that day, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Well, I’m sure that I give it to—I don’t know which porter
was working, just exactly. I think Alfreadia Riggs, or some of them, but I am
sure I give them the key to unlock the back door to carry his trash out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does that back door have a latch on it so that you can push
it and it will stay open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That door requires a key all the time, either way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When they go out, how do they get back in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. They got to leave it open, or either carry the key to come
back in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did they leave it open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. They just walk out on the little ramp. The garbage cans
is sitting right by the building, and they just, oh, about 4 feet from the door
is about all, or 5 feet from the door is all they have to walk. They mostly
have that trash in a sack, and just throw it in the corner and right back in
the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; now, after you had been told not to bring the elevator
down to the basement any more, did you follow those orders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you never brought the elevator down at all any more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir; not until—well, I know it was 11:30, probably 12
o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was after the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes, sir; it was after the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you want to say now that that elevator never came down
to the bottom floor all the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir; it didn’t.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; you also state, so that we can be clear that after you
took the elevator to the first floor the doors of the elevator—the front doors of
the elevator rather were open, but the back door was not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That back was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the elevator, any time you left it, was cut off so that it
couldn’t be operated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It had a key, isn’t that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And without turning the elevator on with the key, it couldn’t
move?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Couldn’t move.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had the key in your possession?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, the elevator didn’t move unless you knew about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you let any porters out after you had been told not to move
the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir; I didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Out the back door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the back door, by the way, was closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s right. So, your statement is that from the time you
were told not to bring the elevator down any more there was nobody who could
have gone out of the door or come into it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Through the elevator door there or that alley door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nobody asked you for the keys to get out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, do you know—what is his name, Alfreadia Riggs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know where he lives?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir; I really don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was his job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. He was a porter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, do you remember allowing Alfreadia Riggs and Harold
Fuqua to go through the back door of the elevator and out of the back door on the
alley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That did not happen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It didn’t happen at any time at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Well, now, not during the period of the time that I had the
elevator cut off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, did it happen at anytime from <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. <span class="locked">Well——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From the time that you were ordered not to bring the elevator
down until after the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir; it didn’t happen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nobody passed through that door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. One lady probably came from—I went to five and got a telephone
operator and brought her down to one. I told her I couldn’t carry her
down to the basement, and she walked down the stairway and she couldn’t get
the elevator. She walked down, and I carried her back up to one, but outside
of that, those two women that I can recall, two women, but I don’t know the
name, but a telephone operator that got the elevator, one of them on the first
floor, and one walked from the first—fifth floor down to the first floor, the—down
the stairway and I carried her back in the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Up to the fifth?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Up to the fifth floor. Outside of that after I got her it was
a telephone man came in just as they left—gave me those orders, but they give
me orders to carry him to the fifth floor and bring him right back, and he was
the last passenger that I carried all the way from the basement to the fifth
floor after I got orders to cut the elevator off, to the fifth floor, he went up there
and right back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see anybody open up either the Commerce Street entrance
or the Main Street entrance and go out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Nobody. I say, the engineerman had a key, and him and a
bunch of them stood in the Commerce side at the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He opened the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. He opened it one time, but now what I can understand—I
don’t know, I think they had three policemen at that door, and they wouldn’t
let him come out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is on the municipal building, first floor, Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Commerce Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And they wouldn’t let him out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir; give him orders they couldn’t let him out. Opened
the first door, and walked out into the lobby, you know, got a little lobby.
This is as far as they got, that lobby there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the Main Street entrance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Nobody went to Main Street. Nobody went to that door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who had the key to those doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Mr. Pierce, the engineer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He is the engineer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where—what is his first name, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. I really don’t know his first name, but he was on duty that
Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He is the engineer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He works in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes; subbasement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Subbasement. That’s where all the engineering equipment and
air conditioning is located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is he the only one who has the keys?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir; I don’t know how many engineermen they have down
there, but I understand every one of them has keys. Every one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have a key?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The keys you had were to the elevator and to the back door facing
on the alley, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you use any kind of a sign-in and sign-out system?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you do so that day when you let the porters out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. The porters don’t sign.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, <span class="locked">they——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir; the porters don’t sign.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what would you say if I’d tell you that both Alfreadia Riggs
and Henry—I think it is Harold Fuqua say they did go out of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. <span class="locked">Well——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Riggs says he went out through the back door, through the back
elevator door and through the door and he walked on down Main Street and
Fuqua says he went out the Main Street entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. During the time that I had it cut off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Well, now, it was they went out of that building, I understand,
but now, they didn’t go out the elevator. What I understand, they went through
the building somewhere and went down in the police department, because that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
is where they got stopped at. At the police department, they got cut off down
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They were in the municipal building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes; they was in the municipal building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was after you had been told not to bring anybody down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes, sir; I saw them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You saw them after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Therefore, the only way they could get down or out of that
building was in one of the methods we have talked about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes, sir; that’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On out the Main Street door, going out the Commerce Street
door, going through the corridor that goes to the jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or going down the steps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or going to the elevator and into the alleyway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s right. One of the two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, do you know how they got out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you willing to state that they did not get out through the
elevator at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. I can’t figure how they could unless one of them had a key,
and I don’t think one of them had a key, because I had the key myself and when
I turned it off I took it with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nobody asked you to take them down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or to open the back door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it possible that the back doors of the elevator were open
when you had the elevator cut off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. I don’t think so. It could have been a button might have
flew open, but I think when I cut it off, when you mash your button, why, it
don’t open until you turn your switch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t leave the back door open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No; I left it closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Sir, if somebody had to open <span class="locked">it——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. It would have been open when I went back to it. It wouldn’t
close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It wouldn’t automatically close?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No way to make it close from the outside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir; when you’ve got it cut off. When it is on automatic
when you cut it off if you leave your doors open they stay open. If you close
them up they stay closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you say they were closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, even pushing the button wouldn’t have opened the back door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The key to the back door of the building that goes out to the
alleyway, was it left in the elevator when you left the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. I hang the keys on a ring and hang them up on the wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Those keys were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So if they had managed to get the elevator door open, they
could have used that key to get the back door leading onto the alley open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Oh, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, you didn’t see anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t see them go out Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir. Now, which way they went out of that, I really do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
not know, but I do learn—I heard them say, myself, they believed they would
go down to the police department and watch television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How would they get to the police department from the main
floor of the municipal building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. They would have had, at least, to went out Commerce Street
and went down and gone down into the basement, or either—or they would
have had to went through the screen door, the door between the two swinging,
so, they had to go one of two ways. The only way to go to the police department
from the municipal building into the police department. After they got
in that alley, they had to go right down in the stairways, as I understand is
where they was, they went downstairs, they had to go out through a gate if
they went downstairs, and they stopped them over in the police department
before they even got over to the televisions. That is where they were stopped
at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your thought is that they used the staircase, the fire stairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir; I think they must have used the door between the
two buildings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean that door that has got two metal doors like an
accordion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they have a key to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. I don’t know whether Riggs had keys or not. He is a truck-driver.
He might have keys of his own. He works daytime and I work nights.
I don’t know too much about it. I don’t know too much about it, but I know
he drives a truck and porter work, and those head boys, some of them has keys.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know this man called Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Never met him before in your life?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, you have seen pictures of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes, sir; that’s all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he come in there that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. I don’t know. I didn’t see him if he did and I don’t think he
did. I really don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you are swearing that you didn’t see him come in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s right; that’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, since all this happened you must have stopped to think
to yourself, “Well, did that man come in through where I was supposed to be?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Oh, yes, sir. I have thought of it, but I know he didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is what I want to find out. You have put your mind to
it and you have thought about it a great <span class="locked">deal——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you are prepared to tell us under oath now, Louis, that
this man did not come through, so far as you know, you didn’t see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s right. That’s right. He come in there some other
way. He didn’t come through that elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you anything else you want to say, Louis, that might
help the President’s Commission in finding out the truth about this thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Well, I don’t—other words about it, I just don’t know anything
I could say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, we certainly don’t want you to invent anything. On the
other hand, we want you to feel free to say anything that is the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes, sir; that’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Because this is an important thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Sure. I realize that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nobody blames you, or anybody. On the other hand, if we
could find out the truth it would help us to protect other people and other
Presidents in the future.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you have given thought to all that, and you are saying
that what you are telling us is the truth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If you should remember sometime something that you haven’t
told us here this morning, or you haven’t told the FBI or the investigating officers,
why, I would like very much for you to contact the President’s Commission
through the U.S. attorney’s office there, Mr. Barefoot Sanders, and
tell us you have something to say to us that hasn’t been said before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And we’ll get in touch with you. Now, let me ask you one
more thing. Has anybody other than the Government officials, U.S. officials
talked to you about this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The police department didn’t talk to you about it at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They didn’t inquire of you as to whether Ruby had come that
way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nobody from the Dallas Police Department ever talked to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nobody has threatened you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They haven’t told you not to tell the truth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s right. Nobody said anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nobody said anything like that to you? Didn’t even speak to
you about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nobody ever took a statement from you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Nobody from the police department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, the FBI, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Yes, FBI; that is the only one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, prior to my speaking to you this morning and taking
this deposition, there had been no interviews between you and me, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean, we haven’t spoken about this matter until you came
into this room and took your oath?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, Louis. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKinzie</span>. Okay. I thank you.</p>

<h2 id="PIERCE">TESTIMONY OF EDWARD E. PIERCE</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of Edward E. Pierce was taken at 2 p.m., on April 1, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, assistant counsel of the President’s
Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Pierce, my name is Leon Hubert. I am a member of the
advisory staff of the General Counsel on the President’s Commission. Under the
provisions of Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, a joint resolution
of Congress No. 137, and the rules of procedure adopted by the President’s
Commission in conformance with the Executive order and joint resolution,
I have been authorized to take a sworn deposition from you. I state to you
now that the general nature of the Commission’s inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate
and report upon facts relating to the assassination of President Kennedy and
the subsequent and violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>In particular as to you, Mr. Pierce, the nature of the inquiry today is to
determine what facts you know about the death of Oswald and any other
pertinent facts you may know about the general inquiry and the physical
setup of the police department and the municipal building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Mr. Pierce, I think you have appeared here today as a result
of an informal request made for you to come here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Under the rules cf the Commission, you are actually entitled to
a 3-day written notice before the taking of this deposition, but the rules also
provide that you may waive that if you wish, and I must ask you first of all,
do you waive the 3-day written notice to which you are normally entitled,
<span class="locked">and——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are ready to go ahead right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Sure. Didn’t even know that I have a choice. In fact, it is quite
fortunate that it came on this day. I am ready, and much prefer, as I expected
this was the time I—and to put it another way, I don’t need the other 3 days.
It is, I understand, for people who have business appointments or other things
and maybe they would, but that is not the case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you stand and raise your right hand. Do you solemnly
swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you tell me your full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Edward Eugene Pierce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your age, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. 45.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your residence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your residence? Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I thought you said, “Resident,” sir. 1726 Michigan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Building and maintenance employee at the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been so employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. 5 years, almost exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, were you on duty in the city hall and police building on
Sunday, November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you come on duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. 7 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Almost exactly 3 o’clock, 5 or 6 or 8 minutes, probably, after 3,
because after 3 o’clock I was no more on duty, as far duty, which is 3 o’clock,
and as far as my actual building, I wanted to look around and see what was
taking place, so, probably 7 or 8 minutes after 3 when I actually drove out
of the basement area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What were your duties, functions and responsibilities in your
position on that day while you were on duty with respect to both buildings,
to wit, the municipal building and the police building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. You covered a lot of ground there. To actually be one-half percent
accurate, I would nearly need the civil service breakdown of that job
responsibility, because you covered all of it. Well, for all practical purposes,
the operation of the city hall and its maintenance is a 24-hour a day operation.
Consequently, we have three shifts—and they have to use some of the personnel,
too, as building engineers, see. If they want one of us they page the building
engineer. Actually, we aren’t the building engineers. We are merely responsible
for the building maintenance and operation of the two buildings, which are
joined together on a 24-hour a day basis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, that on November 24——</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I reported for <span class="locked">my——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were the man in charge of maintenance and operation of
both buildings on the shifts from 7 until 3 that afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. And I was the only one there. That responsibility is handled
by what is called our building operator because of air-conditioning equipment
that must be maintained and operated for both buildings, and we are equipment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
operators, and in building maintenance—also called—that’s a step above building
maintenance six, technically speaking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, those two buildings actually join <span class="locked">together——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They join, as I understand it, in several ways, and I would like
you to explain first of all how a person who is—was on the first floor of the municipal
building could get to the other building, the police building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. On the first floor of the municipal building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Right. How could he get through under normal circumstances?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. To the first floor of the police and courts building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or to any part of the police building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Police department. Very well, sir; simplest way would be to take
the first floor corridor of the municipal building which goes immediately to the
police and courts building. On the weekends, however, on this particular day;
that is on the normal operation any day of the week they are connected and
open, and on the weekends, or after regular municipal building hours in every
night there is an expansion type steel gate closes that municipal building off,
the corridor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does it lock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. From the—it remains locked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But was it locked that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. It was locked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you test it yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Possibly I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could anyone open it but yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I don’t have the only key.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see that door open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. To my knowledge, that door was never open the entire day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you did test it to see that it was locked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. It was locked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you test it prior to the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Not prior to the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. <span class="locked">You——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I saw that the gate was across the corridor, as it should be. I was
on the first floor, a matter of walking about as far as from here, a little further
to the wall, and I didn’t walk up to it prior to the shooting to see that it was
locked, but it was in place and latched.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could have been open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. It was locked. That lock—when that latch was engaged, it was
in place, latched.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From what you could see of it, then—although you didn’t come
up to it, but came to within a distance, which I suggest to you now from the
reference you made a moment ago was about 40 feet, 30 feet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. 60 foot, probably.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You came to within 60 feet of it, and you saw that the latch
was in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. In place and latched, and in that position the door is locked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is locked and you would need a key to open it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. That is my sworn statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Right. And you did not open it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I never saw it open at any time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you did not open it yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. No; but like I say; I checked it, but it was after we knew that
everything had happened, and all of sudden, security got to be of such an utmost
importance, or the urgency of security was such that I pulled on it to see if it
was, but when you said, “prior to,”—prior to that time, I hadn’t, but I do know
it was latched at that time. Was actually locked when I checked it manually
to see if for some peculiar reason the latch was open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What you are saying, in effect, is that while you actually tugged
on the door after the shooting and found it to be locked, that your check of it
prior to the shooting was visual, but that in your opinion it was in a position
that it was locked?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. It is impossible for it not to have been locked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is impossible for it not to have been locked, and that was—that
check was made prior to the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Prior.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much prior? Do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. That would be difficult to say just exactly how much prior,
but it was—to give an actual time on it, of course, when we went to the main
floor, the first floor on the elevator prior to the shooting, in this corridor, that
is a four-way corridor there. There is an information desk sits right in the
intersection of the two corridors, and the several elevators is in the corridor
that leads—that is the reason I say it takes a little describing because it was
facing that corridor and that gate when you get off the elevator, and that was
9:30, probably 9:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, now, what other way is it possible to go from the first
floor of the municipal building into the police building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. From the first floor to the police building, the only way from
the first floor that you can get into the police and courts building is to leave
the municipal building first floor, that is the only way you can get to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And go where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. And go either outside on the—only other way you can get to
it is to go outside on either Main Street or Commerce Street and go down to the
police and courts building and use one of their entrances, or take the service
elevator down to the basement, which you have the model here, and walk
across that garage area and the ramp area to the basement. Two ways, but
no other way you can get there from the first floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About—what about the fire escape stairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. No fire escape.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Isn’t there a fire case <span class="locked">where——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. The enter—staircase, you still can’t get there. It is impossible
to get there, because that staircase is always locked from the municipal building.
That stairway is inside the building proper. It is not an outside stairway
like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. And the entrance to it is always locked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There are two staircases that open onto the main floor of the
municipal building, isn’t that correct, or three?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. One on Commerce Street. One back in the building, and then
another one up on Main Street which goes up into a second floor, but the second
floor they are faced also with the same proposition on weekends, which
you are speaking of here. That entire building is separated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, as to both of those staircases, is it not a fact that they
do not go down into the basement at all. Only one goes down to the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Only one goes down to the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that one is a staircase just off the corridor on the Main
Street side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Right. That goes down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, they have doors that—two doors, sort of swinging doors,
are they not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Not to the first floor; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can’t you at all times use those doors to get into the staircase
and go either up or down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. When you say “those doors,” you are referring to the single
door on each stairway, of which there are two, or still speaking of a one
single door which leads to the stairway which goes down to the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To the basement, the other two do not go down into the basement.
It is the single—that is what I mean, when I said you would have to
leave the first floor and go down into the basement, you could take that stairway,
so that a person getting into the main floor, can get to the police basement
by using that stairway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. That’s right. He can come down it and go out, but he cannot
leave the basement area and go up, because it is always locked. The entrance
to the building is locked. That door is always locked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, going the other way, that is to say, from the main building
down to the basement via that staircase, you would need no key, and that
door is open all the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Even on weekends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Right, sir. That is one of the other means?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, that leaves, I think, one other entrance to the municipal
building, and the entrance in the back on the alleyway. Now, are you familiar
with that entrance and that door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you tell us about that—how that door operates?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. It is a door—double door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. A double door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Comes together and has a lock on it, which when locked is
locked both from the inside—you can’t get out, and the outside you can’t get
in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, when locked you need a key to go either way, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, now, suppose someone had a key and went out that
door, and simply let the door slam behind him, well, would that door be, at that
time, locked or unlocked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. It will be unlocked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To lock it you must use a key to turn the lock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. You have to step outside the door and turn around and use your
keys to lock it back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And, if you don’t do that, it is an open door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. It is an open door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, it might be closed, but all you’d have to do is
turn the knob and go on in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. That’s what I mean. It is open until you take your key and relock
yourself out. No one else can get in without a key.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, do you know whether anyone did go through that door
from the first floor into the alleyway that day from your own knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Not from actually having seen them, but as a matter of my
knowledge, I am quite sure that that door was opened and closed probably
several times prior to the shooting because the porters work. In their normal
assigned work, now, they take out trash and paper sacks and garbage and
whatnot. Mr. Servance, the head porter, always has a key to that door for
the removal of trash.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is the custom with respect to locking or not locking the
door when they routinely perform the porter duties?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. The normal custom is to unlock the door and take their trash
out, and their receptacle for the trash is immediately on the other side of
the door, and as a matter of habit and routine, while they are—they take a
garbage can out on four-wheel dollies and leave the door open there until they
can set the cans over in there, or as close as from here to that door from the
door they have just left open, and they set the full cans off onto the dolly and
pick up the four clean cans and set them back on the dolly and push them back
into the building, and it is only for that period of time, but they relock it
when they come back in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, normally, it is an open door while they are <span class="locked">performing——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. While they are performing their duties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know whether the Main Street entrance to the municipal
building was locked that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. It was locked; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You tested it yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. And I inadvertently did. Not purposely, for any purpose, but
I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say that you inadvertently did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. And I am glad it happened that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, tell us about that, briefly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. The Main Street door is comprised of a revolving door with two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
little vestibule-type doors, one each—that is, one on each side of the revolving
door and the two vestibule doors and revolving door are all locked, and I do
know that they were locked, because for this reason. In the crowd and milling
of curiosity seekers and general public that had gone up and down Main
Street, as well as Commerce, and in an attempt to get in and see what was
going on, a couple—two women looked through the glass of the doors there.
And apparently thought, well, if they could get in here they could see in, because
I believe it was a time—no, I wouldn’t even say I believe it was a
time. It might be they had tried the ramp area, and at any rate, they came
up to the door and tried to get in the revolving door as if to come in off of
Main Street, and apparently not knowing that the building was closed for
the weekend, they thought they could come right in city hall, and I just waved
my hand at them this way [indicating] and they had seen it was locked,
and I waved my hand at them as if to say, “I’m not going to open it for you.
City hall is closed.” We have to do that quite often, because people come
down and want to pay their water bills and we have to say, “We are closed
for the weekend.” And I know it was closed because they were trying to
see if they could get in. In fact, this was the time when even I didn’t know
all this other was going to take place, but I figured, too, curiosity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the Commerce <span class="locked">Street——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. No; it was locked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it ever open in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I opened it myself one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Servance open it one time, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. He was there, but I opened it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand that you all stood in the vestibule?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. The other doors stay open for the convenience of people who
want to make payments of their water bill. There is a bill drop there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you opened the door and stood in the vestibule and sometime
afterward you locked the door back again, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Sometime afterward I did, but there was a whole lot which took
place in between before I locked it back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I am interested in, did anyone come in the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. No one came in the building. That, I can safely swear to. The
reason I opened those two or three doors there which lock the vestibule there
from the entrance to the building that allows people at night, or any hour of
the day to come in and make payments, drop their water bill there, and this is
the reason I refer to it as a vestibule, foyer.</p>

<p>Now, we are making 45 minutes, I would think or an hour’s change in time
with relation to this particular occasion when I opened up. This happened
after we had been told we couldn’t remain in the basement area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you come up from the basement area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. We came up from the basement area and porters asked me why
they couldn’t <span class="locked">stand——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you came up from the basement area, who was operating
the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. McKinzie was operating the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who came up with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I and Servance and Riggs and the telephone operator named
Ruth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And Kelly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Kelly? Did <span class="locked">Kelly——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I don’t know a Kelly. Maybe her last name is Kelly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; this is a man called Edward Kelly. What about Henry, or
Harold Fuqua?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Harold Fuqua remained in the basement momentarily. He remained
in the basement and started to stay and—he did stay—at that time
he wasn’t on the elevator when we came up. He did stay, but later he was
also required to leave though his immediate job responsibility—he stated he
was forced to leave later. At that time he <span class="locked">stayed——</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At any time was the service elevator locked in such a way that
it couldn’t be operated, to your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Are you asking me if there were a time when it was locked?
That, I don’t know. I don’t think it was, but it is possible that it might have
actually been locked but I don’t actually know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the two elevators used during the week, were
they locked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. They were turned off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They couldn’t operate at all? It is possible to lock the service
elevator so that it cannot move?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Well, now, that is an embarrassing question. In 5 years I have
never seen it locked, but all other elevators that I know of do have locks on
the outside, and undoubtedly it does, too, but in my mind I am trying <span class="locked">to——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Isn’t there a lock on the inside that you turn and the elevator
simply becomes immobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Oh, there’s a switch where you can turn off the operation of it.
I was thinking of a lock—oh, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you use a key, to turn the elevator off so that it can’t be used
unless the key is used again to turn it on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. The elevator operator inside the car can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, do you know if the elevator was locked in that way so
that it couldn’t move without switching it back on again with the key?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. To my knowledge, I don’t know. At that point in the story I
would only say that it is my speculation that it probably was not locked, but
it might have been switched off. I think maybe this is not the answer you are
looking for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I have shown you a document consisting of three pages,
purporting to be a report of an interview with you by a special agent Hardin
and Wilkeson. I have seen it “Wilkinson,” spelled both ways.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. He introduced himself to me as Wilkinson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In order to identify it, I am marking it. “Dallas, Texas, April 1,
1964. Exhibit 5132, Deposition of E. E. Pierce,” signing my name, placing my
name and that information on the first page. Putting my initial on the right-hand
bottom of the second page, and my initials on the right-hand side of the
third page at the bottom. You have, I think, read this document now identified
as Exhibit 5132, have you not, Mr. Pierce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I ask you if it is correct? Any changes you would like to make,
anything of that sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. None of any importance. I have been through there. As I read
the article there it occurred to me that maybe a word might have been changed
or a statement as written there might leave the meaning which in actual
analysis was not exactly true. Like I explained it to you, that they referred
to us as building engineers. If a call was sent out for the building engineer
who was in charge on that day, I would go even though I am not a building
engineer, but substantially, the copy of the statement is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, so that the record may show that both of us are talking
about the same document, I would like you to place your name near mine here
on the first page and your initials on the other two pages?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, just your regular signature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. That position on the first floor there, the vestibule there, that we
were speaking of one door being open a while ago, we didn’t pursue that to the
conclusion, but that is where I was. That is the point in the municipal building
where I was at the time Oswald was shot, although, at that time, even until
just a few short minutes, maybe like 5 until 5 or 8 minutes after he was shot
did we know that he had even been shot, and it was immediately after that then
that everyone left that position and I relocked the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Good enough.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. The reason I had to unlock the door is because of human nature,
like everyone else, we wanted to see what was taking place so, I unlocked the
door and—so we could look down the side of the building toward the ramp area,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
which is the one right here [indicating], and see if anything was taking place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, <span class="locked">now.——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Because at that time when the officers out there told us that
we could not remain outside we would have to step back inside and close the
doors, that is where we were. I wanted to finish that part of it so that you
would understand about the door being unlocked, because I was there at the
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that is all you have to say about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I think that it is pretty well covered in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; I think so, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Other than the actual time the door was locked after we left
that area, but it was after he had been shot, and had it <span class="locked">all——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have seen pictures of him, of course, since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I have many times since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him around anywhere on November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or any other date prior to the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. No other date did I see him. As a matter of—I imagine at the
time, because there were so many, and I hadn’t seen any—I didn’t even know
he existed, and in the crowd of people that were there, it is very possible that
he might have been in the group that I saw as I worked back and forth, but he
could have been there, but I didn’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, you have <span class="locked">no——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Nothing but hearsay to the effect that he was there from time
to time. It developed later that he had been in the building there several
times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, you don’t know that from your own knowledge at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I do not know it, and even at that time I wouldn’t have known
him if I would have seen him because I didn’t know he existed much less what
he looked like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, one other area I would like to explore, there is an area
called the subbasement, is there not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is below <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. It is <span class="locked">immediately——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Below the actual basement used for parking area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. That is this area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In that subbasement you have all your actual machinery?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it possible to get into the subbasement from the outside on
Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. On a weekend, normally; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is a door, though?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. There is a door that connects the subbasement with the staircase
that leads to the sidewalk on Commerce Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Now, that door is normally locked on weekends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Always locked on weekends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Unless, inadvertently, someone left it open. It is supposed to be—and
it is all the time when I am on duty, it is locked. Because I don’t want
<span class="locked">any——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it locked on November 24, all the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. It was locked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were in charge of it, and you say that it was locked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Yes. Now, with this reservation being that the head porter, our—Mr.
Servance, also has a key to that door, because the porters’ quarters, their
locker room area and quarters, what we refer to as quarters generally is on the
outside of that door in the police and courts building proper, and to get to it—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>their
duties and in this garage area here, and in the municipal building, they
are required to go in and out of that door to get their assigned jobs. He has
a key, and when I say, “to my knowledge it was locked,” the only reservation is
that at sometime he was there and present in that area, and it was locked unless
opened by him, or a porter who was working.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, if a person could get into this subbasement, he could go very
easily into the basement, itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No locked door between them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. No locked doors. It has the stairway that goes from the subbasement,
the stairway level up <span class="locked">to——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What kind of a lock is there on that subbasement door that you
are talking about? Do you need a key to get in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you pass through the door does it automatically lock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. That is a push button type lock.
It is true, you can let yourself out of the subbasement and go out towards their
area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Porters’ area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. And when it closes back, it is locked. It locks, and to come back
through you have to use your key again unless you are going to be there for
some period of time, you want to be—you can push the button you are speaking
of automatically and that releases itself automatically. If you push the button
it remains unlocked for you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That would be true also if a person was coming from the outside
and wanted to get into the subbasement, or you—use the key to get in and
when the doors shuts again, it is locked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. It is locked; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, I think that about covers it, Mr. Pierce. Have you
been interviewed by any member of the President’s Commission to your knowledge,
sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. As for the—any personnel going in the garage area there at the
time he was shot, I guess I am not in the position to say positively there was
no one other than news personnel or media and police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, you don’t know that to be a fact, do you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I was fixing to say that I would be willing, even though I am
under oath here, to swear to tell the truth, that there was no one there, because
those personnel we have mentioned here, Riggs and Fuqua, at the time we were
forced to leave, and came up, you know, I mentioned he remained in the basement
momentarily there until it was evident that he also would have to leave.
Then he and Harold went to the—because of the availability there of a television
set, went to the police locker room lounge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, do you know that of your own knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I do know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or have you been told?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Well, as a matter of security I mentioned it, because after they
got to that position then they couldn’t even come back and were required to
stay there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, you know that only because other people told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. That is where they were required to stay. That is where they
spent the remainder of their time, because they could not come back and
rejoin us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know how they left that building to get to the police
recreation room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. From the elevator area here—let’s see; no, I don’t know if they
walked directly across to a stairway there, another stairway that goes to the
police locker lounge other than the stairway we are speaking of, comes from
Commerce Street down to the subbasement itself, and in the building. A stairway
which policemen use all the time to go down to the lockers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean from the municipal building?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. No; from the garage area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From the garage area, right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. But, from the municipal building that is not so. From being
required to stay there and unable to even leave there, even now, like I said, I
can’t possibly state there was no one else there, but I do know they weren’t in
this area, because they were supposed to be—stay where they were <span class="locked">and——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know how they got out of the municipal building that
they were in with you to get to the police room, from your own knowledge? Not
what somebody else told you, but from your own knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. From my own knowledge; no, sir. I don’t know. Now, there
was a small interval of time elapsed when we first left the basement area here
on the elevator and came up to the first floor. McKinzie was the operator of
the elevator, which has a buzzer system on it for calling, and as such, is required
to answer calls to whatever floor the personnel is calling for elevator
service there, because that is the only elevator in operation, and he did answer
a call or two probably from the phone operators up on five, like I say, when
we left the basement area and went up to one, he was there, too, and in that
small interval of time, I would say about 10 minutes, he came back and reparked
the elevator there on one and said that—told me that a policeman had told
him not to answer any more calls on that elevator. To even remove the elevator
completely from the basement area, and don’t answer any more calls
until notified later. And that—and that elevator stayed there then at that
point there is one of the things that entered my mind a while ago when you
were speaking of—about the elevator being shut off, and the operator can turn
a switch and turn it out of service, and he brought up the elevator and told me,
and Servance was there, at the time, and Servance is his immediate boss, and
told Servance that he had been instructed not to answer any more calls on that
elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I asked you whether or not you know how Riggs and
Fuqua got out of the building? What way they used to get out of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Now, they left us where we were there in that small interval of
time and it is possible that they went back down and walked across to the
stairway that goes to the police locker room, is—that is the only way they
could get to it, if they took that route, actually, the question was, “Do I know
how?”, and I’m not certain, because I did not follow them or go with them.</p>

<p>The easiest way, across the other stairway and went down to the police
locker room or that stairway from Commerce Street down to the porters’ quarters,
and the subbasement where our equipment is, from that stairway there is
a door that is locked there, also. They would have to have a key. If they got
in the police locker room there is a fire escape from the locker room out to
the outside in case they ever have to leave, but you cannot go into it without
a key.</p>

<p>If they used that route, they had to use a key, which I don’t know if anybody
has a key or not.</p>

<p>It is the only two ways they could have gotten there, and at that time when
they were immediately clearing out of this area, it is very possible the policemen,
knowing that they were building maintenance employees, and been seeing them
for years, especially John the head porter, why, and Harold Fuqua in charge
of parking of cars in this basement area, might have said it was all right for
them to take these stairs down to the locker room as they were going to have
to leave this area anyway. They could either have gone to the—they could
either have gone from the municipal building down the stairs or permitted
them to go back into the police and courts building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, they have gotten out of the municipal building by
going through the service elevator, through the alleyway door and out through
the alley to Main Street, couldn’t they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. They could have, but they couldn’t have gotten—they would have
to come back into this basement area down this ramp in order to get into where
the stairway is to go down to the police locker room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, they could have gone down the police department building
entrance on Harwood, down into this basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. They would have had <span class="locked">to——</span></p>

Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Walked around the block, so to speak?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. And come down the elevator and walked from there down to
the locker room where they did stay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Okay. Thank you very much, sir. I appreciate it.
I think that’s it. Do we have everything that you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. If it be of help. I am privileged to be of help. If I have, I’m glad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. <span class="locked">Good——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. In fact, I trust that I have. At least, we ascertained—like I
told her. I might have written it myself, but, actually, it was written from
statements that I made, so that <span class="locked">is——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are talking about Exhibit 5132?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. The statement that I read there; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you very much, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, you can go out this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. I will testify now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Will you stand and raise your right hand so that you
may be sworn? Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give
will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Alfreadia Riggs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your residence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Right now I live at 49—I mean 5942 Highland Hill Drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Highland Hill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Highland Village—Village Drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Highland Village Drive. Is that in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation, Mr. Riggs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. I’m a porter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. For the city of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At city hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. At city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been so employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Oh, approximately 7 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your occupation before that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Well, I was—drove a truck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. For the city?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. No, sir; for the Sunshine Laundry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been employed as a porter at the municipal
building in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. That is approximately 7 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Seven years. In other words, all the time you have been working
<span class="locked">there——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. That is <span class="locked">only——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. For Dallas Public Works Department you have worked in that
building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What are your hours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Generally from 6 until 2:45.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Six in the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes; every day except Saturday and Sunday. Actually, sometimes
I work weekends. We do a little extra work on Saturday and Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you get paid extra for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who determines when you do extra work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Well, the head porter and our supervising engineer, Mr. Homer
Garland usually picks out certain things for us to do, and the head porter will
tell us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is the head porter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Charles Gill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. G-i-l-l?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I understand that you were working and on duty on November
24, the date that Oswald was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. That’s right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why were you working that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Well, I was doing work inside the new city hall. Well, in the old
building. We was cleaning the floors, because we had quite a few photographers
in around, and they wanted us to keep the stuff off the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By the old building you mean the building now occupied by the
Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The new building that you refer to is the municipal building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Municipal building, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you report for work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. I would say 7 o’clock, 7 o’clock that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who ordered you to go to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Well, Gill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you worked the day before, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. This was <span class="locked">on——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Sunday, no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you worked on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. No, sir; I don’t believe I worked that Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you worked on Friday night until Saturday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir; I was absent, actually, I worked, you know—it is my
regular work through—weekly day from 6 until 2:45, and like I say, if you
work weekends, usually work from 7 until 3. Actually, from 6 and—until 3.
Usually come in a little earlier at various times, but this day I believe I came in
at 7.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I mean is that on Saturday, the day before this day, did
you work your regular hours <span class="locked">or——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. I’m trying to think, because we had quite a bit of work that weekend,
because actually, we had quite a few people over in the other building.
They sent different ones. Only time I remember is—that day I don’t know
whether I worked that night before then, because I had worked quite a bit on
that weekend, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, for the purposes of identification, I’m going to mark a document
which purports to be a photostatic copy of a sign-in sheet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of porters and maids at the city hall on November 24, 1963, as
follows: “Dallas, Texas, April 1, 1964. Exhibit No. 5128, deposition of
Alfreadia Riggs.” I am signing my name, and then another document also
purporting to be sign-in sheet for the city hall porters and maids, dated November
23, 1963, and I am marking that at the bottom, “Dallas, Texas, April 1,
1964. Exhibit 5128-A, Deposition of Alfreadia Riggs.” I am signing my name
on it. Now, I will ask you to look at this document that has been marked
Exhibit 5128, and see if your name is on it in print, and if your handwriting
is on that document?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that your—next to your printed name is that your signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the two columns that appear, “Sign in 7 a.m.,” “Sign out
5:30 p.m.”—no, 3 p.m., is that your handwriting, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Both of those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, look at the document marked 5128-A. Next to your printed
name I see A.R., those are your initials?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, there is a sign-in 11 p.m., and a sign-out at 7 a.m., does
that mean you went on duty at 11 o’clock on that Saturday night, and got off at
7 o’clock in the morning, Sunday, or does it mean you signed in at 11 o’clock
on Friday night and got off at 7 o’clock on Saturday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. This, I believe I worked that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. When it says—Saturday, 23.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Until Sunday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Until Sunday morning. That is when I was signing out, and I
worked right on through that Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you didn’t go home at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. No, sir; not until 3 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, what it amounts to is that you started at 11 o’clock Saturday
night and carried clean on through until that Sunday, but you signed in and
signed out twice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. We usually have to do that on two different sheets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you were assigned particularly to what location?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Well, just 11—from 11 to 7, it was on the elevators.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. From 11 o’clock that night until 7 o’clock the next morning I was
on the elevators, and then on this other deal, from 7 until 3 was cleaning up the
Police and Courts Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when you got off the elevator at 7 o’clock, who relieved you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. McKinzie, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Louis McKinzie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you finish cleaning up the police building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Well, we never did finish cleaning it up, because after the incident
came <span class="locked">about——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After Oswald was shot, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. There was so much disturbance in the halls, actually, I was never
able to get back over there in the building to clean it up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you in the municipal building at any time during the 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am not talking about the police building, I am talking about
the municipal building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you do any work in the municipal building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you get from the municipal building to—no, from the
police building where you were working to the municipal building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Well, I came down through the basement. It wasn’t—trying to
think all who were down in the basement. We was all standing around. It was
Harold, Gill, Kelly, and if I’m not mistaken, I think Pierce all standing around
in the basement, and the police was searching the rafters and checking the cars
for guns and things, and finally whenever sergeant—actually I don’t know
exactly his name—gave orders for them to clear out everybody in the basement
down there, so, we got on the elevator and went to the first floor in order to
look out the door. We—to see when they got him out to the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. I think Servance had opened up the front door in the municipal
building, and we was standing between—which it has two doors, one stays locked
all the time, and one stays open because they have a meter where people put their
water deposits in a little box. He had opened the doors on the inside, and we
was standing between the two doors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which doors are you talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. On Commerce Street side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who opened that door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Servance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Servance. Now, what other entrances are there to the first floor
of the municipal building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. How many entrances?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; how can you get into it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Well, we have one that leaves from the first floor to the Police
and Courts Building, which it stays shut over the weekend, or on the weekend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Sort of a metal gate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Swinging gate like an accordion. It swings out and blocks the
corridor that runs between the two buildings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that open or closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say <span class="locked">that——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Kept closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who keeps it closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Well, usually the porter that works at night closes it up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you check it to see that it was closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. No, sir; I looked and it seemed to be closed actually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say that this gate, like a metal gate that runs from
the floor to the ceiling, was pulled to, but you don’t know if it was locked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it possible to lock that door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. It is possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it possible to lock that corridor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you have that door, you have an entrance from Commerce
Street, and there is an entrance on Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the condition of that door on Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Well, it was—well, I presume it was closed, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it usually?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir; during the weekend the old building is closed. Like I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
say, I couldn’t verify to say that it was closed or it was open, because actually,
I did not check it, <span class="locked">but——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You knew normally that it is closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. It is closed, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it locks so that you can’t get in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what about the entrance to the building, that entrance
and exit to the building, that leads to the alleyway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. The heavy back door back there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is a back door back there, isn’t there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, does that door remain open, or closed, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Well, it remains closed, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Closed all the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. All the time. We usually keep a key on the elevator that will
open the back door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The door that goes to the alley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir; that goes into this alley, but it will not open either the
front door or the Harwood side or Main side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That key is kept on a ring in the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, to go from the main floor of the municipal building, that
is, from the first floor to that alleyway, you have to go through the service elevator,
don’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the service elevator has two doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. One that opens up on the Main Street corridor of the municipal
building, and the other one that opens up on a corridor and leads to the back
door that leads to the alleyway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. To the alleyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the key to that back door is in the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. On the elevator, yes, sir. Now, there is another way, too, on the
first floor that you can go down the stairway and go to the basement from the
first floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that the fire escape?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that is never closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that if anybody is on the first floor they can get into the
basement by using the fire escape, or using the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, besides the service elevator that we already talked about,
the one that has two doors, there are two other elevators on that floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir; but they usually cut off. They don’t have but one elevator,
and call it the freight elevator, the one that runs over the weekend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The other two were closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They were closed that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir; they were cut off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, now, I think you were saying that Mr. Servance
opened the Commerce Street door, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If you will, tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Well, after we left from the basement and went to the first
floor, he opened the door on the Commerce Street side, and we stood up there
between the two doors, approximately, I’d say 45 minutes to an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say between the two doors, you mean that on Commerce
Street there is an outside door, and a sort of a vestibule, and then
inside doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Sort of wind-break doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir; which actually, the outside door stays open because they
have, like I said, they have the deposit meter where you can pay your bills and
they keep it open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that the outside doors on the Commerce Street side are
always open, but then the inside doors also on the Commerce Street side are
closed on weekends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Servance opened the inside door and then where did
you all go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. We stood in between.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In—you never did go out the outside door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. No, sir; because we had an officer outside the door. He was
standing on the steps there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, what happened after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. After we stood around there a certain length of time, I don’t know
exactly how long, I’d say approximately 45 minutes or an hour, then the
armored car came up, and they started backing down the ramp, and Harold and
myself decided that we <span class="locked">would——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Pardon. Fuqua?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Fuqua; yes, sir. We decided we would try to go down in the
police locker room and maybe watch it on television. We came from the first
<span class="locked">floor——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you left the Commerce Street entrance—did you close it?
Did you lock it up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. No, sir; because Servance and the rest of them were still standing
up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you left before they did, and you don’t know whether he
locked it or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Then only Harold and myself left. We came in the elevator, I got
the keys, unlocked the back door, and I locked it back. I still had the keys.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when you went through the elevator door, did you leave it
open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The elevator door that is on the alleyway side was left open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you took the key out of the elevator for the back door on
the alleyway, and you opened that back door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you kept the key?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, did you leave that back door open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, what do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. I made sure I locked it back, because actually we usually are
supposed to lock the door, keep it locked, and when I unlocked the door from
the inside and in turn, took the key and put it on the other side and locked it
back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. We left from the alleyway and walked to the left as we went out
the back door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Towards Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Towards Main Street, yes, sir; and got to Main Street, turned
left going towards Harwood, and then as we passed—which is a driveway that
leads down to the ramp on the Main Street side, well, we sort of glanced down
through that-a-way to see, you understand. We saw that armored car which we
couldn’t see from up there on the top. Then we left, and went to Harwood,
made a left, which was going towards Commerce off of Main Street, which is
on Harwood, and as you get to the—between the blocks of the building, half way,
they have a—steps that leads down into the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On the Harwood Street side of the steps that lead down into
the basement? Did you go down those steps?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Actually, Harold asked me to go down and check and see if it
would be all right for us to go down because we were under the impression that
they had the police—had a police officer on the door. After I went down and
checked and there wasn’t anyone and then I turned and told him to come down
and he and I came on down too, and well, the photographers and all was in
the basement. All—we passed on by, and went down to the police basement,
which is—opposite from the prop room. You have to go down the hall and
down the steps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean you went down into the locker room? That is where
all the policemen have their lockers and there’s a recreation room and television
<span class="locked">and——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir; and television and—and there was a jail attendant down
there, actually he didn’t work in the jail office, he is not a policeman, but he
works in the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is his name? Do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. No, sir; I really don’t. He told us that he didn’t think they were
going to show it on television. He imagined they were going to run a tape and
show it later on. Said, “Well, we should have stayed up there. Maybe we
could have seen him when they brought him out—” While we were down there
I bought a little can of soup, or chili or something, and I was eating as we came
back up to the—and we stood on the opposite wall from the corridor that leads
out to the basement from the hallway that goes out to the basement, and where
it has a door—I’m sorry, I couldn’t explain, but actually it leads to the basement,
goes where they park the cars. We was standing up—opposite—in other words,
two corridors, you understand, separate that, and well, we was standing up
there maybe about 5 minutes, one of the newspapermen said, “Here he come,
here he come,” and well, we got on the other side of the wall and was trying
to look, well, so much rushing and all that actually we didn’t see anything, and
then did hear the shot, didn’t actually sound like a shot, sort of muffled out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you in the basement at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On the Commerce Street side, or the Main Street side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. It was in between, because it is—if you had been down there, there
is a way that comes through the basement, pass by the jail office and corridor
where you turn left, and go down there, turn right, and police assembly room
is down at the far end, and go up there way, and <span class="locked">go——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go through the engineer’s room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. No, sir; this is down in the police building where the records, the
information is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, perhaps if you look at this thing over here, this mockup,
you will be able to clarify this. Now, this is the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And see back over there is the parking area. This mockup
doesn’t show the elevators, but I have a map here which is a chart, really,
of that same area only more extensive. For instance, here is the jail office,
here are these two ramps, and this mockup only goes to here, you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what I want you to do is to identify this first by marking
as follows: “Dallas, Texas, April 1, 1964, Exhibit 5129, deposition of Alfreadia
Riggs,” I am signing my name on it, and so that the record may show that
we are both talking about the same thing, I’m asking you to put your name
below mine on there. Now, I want you to look at the mockup first and locate
first where you were when the shot was fired, then we’ll mark it on the
map.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Well, actually, they didn’t have it on here, just this part here is
extended out, see what I am referring to is this corridor leads down here
that goes to the police assembly room, this part here is—corridor here leads
towards Commerce Street side. Now, it has—along here it has a corner here,
that is what—two corridors there, and this is just a wall what leads into
the elevators. Now, when—actually when they—when they was bringing him
out, we were standing on this side, and when they brought him out we moved
from here over to here [indicating].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, sir, you have testified that actually, your first
position is not shown on either the mockup or the map?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, if it were on the map, it would be shown at the bottom
of the map?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. That’s right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you moved up to a position about here [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, I am marking an “X” and putting a circle around it as to the
position you moved to when you heard the shot, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am marking in my own handwriting, “Position of Alfreadia
Riggs at the time of shooting.” I am putting that in a circle and connecting
it to the smaller circle with the “X” in it. The smaller circle with the “X”
in it being the spot at which Alfreadia Riggs testified he was standing at the
time of the shot, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And Fuqua was with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you had come from a position that, if it were on the map,
would be toward the bottom of the map?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recognize the position of the service elevator here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After you had been told to get out of the parking area marked
here, and you had gone up with these others on the service elevator to the first
floor, did you ever get back into this part on the map called parking area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Well, only after everything was over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand, but prior to the shooting, you never did get back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Never did get back down there; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had gone through the service elevator, not on the area
shown by this Exhibit 5129, because that is the basement area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But on that same service elevator on the next floor up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And went through that elevator to the back door, turned to
your left onto Main Street, passed the ramp on Main Street, went over to
Harwood Street, went down into the basement area through the Harwood
<span class="locked">Street——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Entrance; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Entrance that goes down to the basement. Then you went
to the recreation room and finally came to the position you indicated just
before the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you get back to the main floor of the municipal building
after the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. After the shooting—during the excitement and that, during the
excitement Harold and I, we went over to the police information room over
there to get out of the way of the traffic. The police was all—they was
closing all the entrances and wasn’t letting anyone in and letting no one out,
so, in order to keep from being in the way, we went inside the information
room, and stayed over there, I imagine 30 minutes, 20 or 30 minutes, and
Harold asked chief—I think it was Chief Lumpkin for him to escort us from
there to the basement, because—I think he wanted to go home, or his time was
up or something. He wanted to get out of there, because it made him pretty
nervous, and Chief Lumpkin escorted us through the corridor there that leads
to the basement to the parking area, and we went over there and stayed, or
was down in the basement, and after the time elapsed, I went down in our
porter room and stayed around there until time for me to get off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do with the keys that you had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. I put them back in the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You put them back in the elevator on what floor?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. In the basement there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was the elevator down in the basement then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Well, I called it down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was McKinzie operating the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes; he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he see you put the keys back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. I don’t know for sure. During the excitement and all of that,
I think—I don’t know whether he and I or someone got to talking about the
incident, and I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you did not go out through the Main Street door when
you went out with Fuqua?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. No, sir; definitely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Back in the alley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Back in the alley; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you had the keys with you all the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why did you take the keys with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Well, because there was only this once that—well, actually, I
usually, normally have a key. As a matter of fact, I have quite a few keys.
I didn’t have mine with me during that time, and that was the only one during
that time that would open up that door that was available, and it stays in the
elevator, we close that, because lots of times some of those porters in the other
building will use the keys in the elevator to put trash out this back door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, that door, as a matter of fact, can only be opened from
either side. You need a key no matter which way you are coming from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It can’t be set so that it is open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. You have to unlock it from the inside and going out, to lock it
back, you have to lock it from the outside. In coming back through you have
to unlock it from the outside with the key.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, I understood that that back door would not open in
any way without a key so that if you went through it with a key it would close
by itself and you would need a key to get back in again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You couldn’t put a snap on that to keep it open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is no snap?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. No, sir; I don’t think. You have to use a key.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were in uniform that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That uniform, is a well-known uniform?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. It is gray with red letters. It has “City of Dallas,” on the left
side, and name on the right of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your name sewed on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir, embroidered on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. First initial and last name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I am showing you a document which purports to be a report
of an interview of you by FBI Agent Jack Peden, and I am marking it for identification
as follows: “Dallas, Tex., April 1, 1964, Exhibit 5130, deposition of
Alfreadia Riggs,” and putting my name on the first page and since it has a second
page I am marking on the second page my initials in the lower right-hand
corner. I would like you to read that report and see if it reflects the truth, as
far as you know it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. That’s right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, in order that the record can show that we are both talking
about the same document, I would ask you to sign your name below mine on the
margin there, or next to it, and place your initials on the second page as I have
done. Now, you have signed your name on the first page of Exhibit 5130, and
your—put your initials on the second page. Have you read it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does it represent the truth?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any corrections or alterations to be made, or anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. My—no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you willing to state that if we consider the facts stated in
Exhibit 5130 and the facts as stated by you in this deposition that we have
everything whatsoever that you now know about this matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nothing that is left out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Everything is correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir. Everything is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I should have added that if we also consider the information you
have testified to on Exhibit 5128 and 5128-A, that is the sign-in sheet, we have
the full information of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, have you been previously interviewed by any
member of the President’s Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. No, sir; I haven’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have not been interviewed previously by me, or anybody who
identified themselves as being connected with the President’s Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, Alfreadia, I just want to get clear once again on one
point. Is it possible, at all, that you went out of the municipal building through
the Main Street entrance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With Fuqua?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. No, sir; we definitely went through the back door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You and Fuqua?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Riggs</span>. Yes, sir; me and Harold Fuqua.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, that’s all, thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="SERVANCE">TESTIMONY OF JOHN OLRIDGE SERVANCE</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of John Olridge Servance was taken at 11:45 a.m., on April 1,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the
President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of John O. Servance.</p>

<p>Mr. Servance, my name is Leon Hubert. I am a member of the advisory staff
of the general counsel of the President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Under the provisions of the Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963,
a Joint Resolution of Congress No. 137, and the rules of procedure adopted by
the Commission in conformance with the Executive order and joint resolution,
I have been authorized to take a sworn deposition from you, Mr. Servance.
I state to you now that the general nature of the Commission’s inquiry is to
ascertain, evaluate, and report upon any fact relating to the assassination of
President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.
In particular as to you, Mr. Servance, the nature of the inquiry today is to
determine the facts that you know about the death of Oswald and any other
pertinent facts you may know about the general inquiry, and particularly the
opening of doors and so forth of the municipal office or building. Now, you
have appeared here by informal request made for you to come. Under the
rules adopted by the Commission you are actually entitled to a 3-day written
notice before you can be required to come, but on the other hand, the rules of
the Commission provide that a witness may waive the 3-day notice if he sees
fit to do so. Since you have not had the 3-day written notice, I will ask you
if you are willing to waive the 3-day written notice and have your testimony
taken now?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. I will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you stand and raise your right hand so that you may be
sworn. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony that you are about to give
will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you please state your name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. My name is John Olridge Servance. [Spelling] S-e-r-v-a-n-c-e,
sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Servance. How old are you, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. I am—beg your pardon, I am 54 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. I live at Lancaster, 319 Lancaster, Hutchins Road. Lancaster
Hutchins, 319 Lancaster Hutchins Road, Lancaster, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what is your present occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. I am a—the head porter, I believe that is the way it is listed,
foreman or supervisor, you might call it, over both buildings at night. The
city hall and the municipal city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Those buildings annex, actually, not two separate buildings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Some connections.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, will you—we’ll go into that in a minute. How long have
you been so occupied, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Will be 17 years the 2d day of July, or let’s say 16.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been head porter out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Well, I would presume about 15 years. I was head porter
before I come down there with some other part of the city. I was with the
water department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I am marking a document which purports to be a report
of an interview with you by FBI Agent Jack Peden, as follows: “Dallas, Texas,
April 1, 1964, Exhibit 5131, deposition of John O. Servance,” and I am signing
my name on this document which is a one-page document, and so that the record
may show that we are both speaking about the same document would you place
your name below mine on that document, sir? You may use this pen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Below yours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, just anywhere there to the side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Servance, have you read this document?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Exhibit 5131, which you have just signed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. I read it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it correct and true?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any alterations or modifications that you wish to make to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. No, it isn’t. Now, I mean, as far as I understood it. As far
as I could remember, that is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, you have just read it, haven’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it seems to be correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, do you know Alfreadia Riggs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And Henry Fuqua?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Hal Fuqua.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Hal Fuqua, is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see them in the basement that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. I saw them in the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And all of you were sent up the service elevator by the police
to the first floor of the municipal building, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. That’s right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is true that at one time during the course of the morning
there you opened the inside door on the Commerce Street entrance of the
municipal building so you all could look out?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Well; yes, sir. I did, I opened the door. We stood—there’s
a glass vestibule, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You stood in this vestibule. The outside doors to Commerce
Street remain open all the time, and the inside door is locked. You had a key
and you unlocked it and all of you stood in the vestibule for a while, is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. For a while, that’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened to Riggs and Fuqua? Do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. They was standing there. What I mean, we were there during—all
the excitement, I don’t know—everything just—I don’t know what way—I
thought they were still there. I didn’t see them. I mean, that <span class="locked">is—</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you left the vestibule, did you lock the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. I locked the door, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did anybody come in through the Commerce Street entrance
while you were standing there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could anyone have come in without your noticing it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. No, sir; they couldn’t have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why do you say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Well, first place, the door wasn’t opened all the time, just
for a few moments, and the next place there was a policeman out on the outside
didn’t allow us to come—and give us orders to go back in and shut it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see, and anyhow, if anyone had come in probably you would
have seen them, isn’t that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Mr. Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Never seen him before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He didn’t pass through that door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. No, sir; he didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you definitely locked it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what other entrances or exits are there to the first floor
of the municipal building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Well, now, you would have—the first floor, we have a gate
leading from the city hall now, the old building from the <span class="locked">municipal——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The police building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Yes, sir; police building, I’ll put it that way, it was locked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, a corridor that connects the old police building
and the new municipal building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it has a sort of an accordianlike gate which spreads across
the whole thing and runs from ceiling to floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does it lock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. It was locked this day, the 24th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was? You know that to be a fact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. I made sure. I locked it and then doublechecked it in the
morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was never opened, then, as far as you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what about the Main Street entrance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Well, it was locked; no one went out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you know that to be a fact, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what about the two elevators other than the service
elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. They were cut off, completely off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Well, every evening when I went there, every night they cut
them off. Well, then, I tested them to see were they off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you test them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Mashed the button to see if it don’t run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You tried on this morning to get—to make sure the elevators
were cut off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Their power is cut off. They are cut off. You have to go
up on the penthouse on top and cut them off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They are cut off every night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. And on weekends. Weekends; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What other ways are there to get into the municipal building
from the first floor? We have Commerce Street and Main Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. They have the rear exit there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Well, you see, the service elevator has the double doors,
you open both of those doors there and go out the service elevator, you can
go out now, to the service elevator; we do have a way that will unlock—well,
in fact, have a chain of keys there and that if anyone—anybody that is
working on any of those floors during the weekends, well, they can get those
keys and go in there and out the back, if they want.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, that back door to the building, that leads to what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Oh, it leads to the alley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Leads to the alley? Is there a key in the elevator that opens
the back door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. They were open; that’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you familiar with how that back door works?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can the back door be opened at any time without the key?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In there—any button that you can push so you don’t need a key?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, to go to that door, once it is closed, now, coming
from either way, from inside the building or from outside the building, you
have to have a key to make that door operate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Yes, sir; you really do. No, no, now, you can push shut, you
can snap the door and remain open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If you want that door to stay open you’ve got to prop it open.
Once the door is closed you need a key no matter which way you are coming?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. It is a door you have to lock, you know, you don’t—it has
got a catch there, but you have to lock it, you know, it is not a turn—you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you mean that you can go through that door and then
when it closes you—it is not locked unless you turn it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Well, that’s right. See, we can trip it off, you have got a
double lock, you understand. You know the doors got a night latch like—you
know, but in order to lock that door it has got another lock in there that
we turn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me put it to you this way: Suppose a man uses the key
to get through the door from the outside of the building, now, the door closes
shut automatically, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does it lock so that you need the key to get back inside, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It does not lock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. It does not lock. In order to lock it from the alleyway side
so that nobody can come in you have got to turn it. Put the key and turn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Otherwise the door is open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. That’s right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, let’s go through that again, because it is very important
and I want to get it for sure. That door operates only with a key, that is to
say, from the inside. You can’t just use the door without a key from the
inside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Let’s put it this way. Once you lock the door you have
to have a key to unlock it. Now, see, you shut that door, it catches, but it is
not locked. See what I mean? But in order for that door to be locked we
have to put a key in there and turn that lock and let that come out and go
into that socket, you see?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, a man who is going through those doors leading from the
municipal building to the alleyway uses the key to open the door to get out
into the alleyway. Now, when he leaves and goes down the alleyway and has
taken these keys with him, is that door then open so that somebody can come
in without a key or do you need a key to get back in again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Well, now, if—usually, if the fellow’s got the key, he usually
locks it when he goes out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, if he locks it back when he got—when he goes out but he
didn’t lock it <span class="locked">again——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. You don’t need no key.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The door is open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. You don’t need a key.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know from your own knowledge whether Riggs and
Fuqua went through that alley door that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. I couldn’t say. I mean, I don’t—I mean I don’t recall that.
There is a possibility that they could have, but I don’t recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you don’t know from your own knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. After the excitement came and hollering of the elevators—I
mean the sirens going we were watching the armored car being backed to the
entrance of that—cars coming out of there from the basement and if they did,
I didn’t know it, I mean, I can’t recall it. There is a possibility, but actually
to say, I couldn’t say it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They were in uniforms, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Yes, sir; they were in uniforms and working around there. In
fact, Riggs was in both of the buildings, you know. He was a porter there that
day for certain, and he had access of those things. What he did—I mean, I
only seen him there, and he disappeared, I didn’t notice it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is one other way you can go down from the municipal
building to the basement, and that is through the fire escape, that is to say, the
door to the main floor of the municipal building is not locked, and you can get
to the staircase that way, can’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the door at the bottom of the stairway, which is the entrance
of the basement is always open so that you can get into the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Not the weekends. You have to—you can come out, but you
can’t go in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s what I mean. You can go in from the municipal building.
You can go through the fire escape doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They are not locked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. They are locked; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They are locked on Sundays?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Locked on Sundays, but, you see, you can come out, you have
a big bar that you can mash and come out of but you lock it and you can’t go in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Am I right in saying then that from the municipal floor, first
floor of the municipal <span class="locked">building——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You cannot go into the staircase?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Not during the weekend. They keep it locked, or either at
night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Always locked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Always locked, but you can always come out of there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; in other words, if you are in the staircase itself, you can
come out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Come out, that’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, a man on the first floor of the municipal building can’t go
from the first floor to the basement by use of that staircase, can he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Yes; inside he can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; once they get inside the staircase, yes, but suppose he is
standing on—in the lobby on the first floor, can he get through those fire escape
doors and get into the staircase and then go down and out into the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Well, now, let me kind of clear this. You see, you have three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
sets of those. You have two in the building, and one that comes on the outside
on the Commerce Street side. Is that the one you are speaking of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; I am thinking of the one in the main lobby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Well, in the main lobby, if you are in the main lobby you can
through the door, go in the door, down from the staircase, on down in the
basement and go out, but you couldn’t come in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, let me put it to <span class="locked">you——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Yes; you can come in. You can go out or come in. See, those
doors are not locked up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s what I thought. You said that door is locked on weekends,
but you wish to correct that now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Yes, sir; here’s what I was speaking of, now, when you get in
the basement, when you go down to the basement those doors are locked as far
as coming in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. From the basement, that’s right. In other words, if you are
in the basement you cannot use that fire escape door to get into that staircase;
that’s right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, if you are in the staircase you can get into the basement.
Now, the doors to the main floor of the municipal building leading to the
staircase that we are talking about, are not closed, they are not locked, are
they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I think a little earlier you testified that they were locked
and the only way you can use them would be coming from the staircase
into the first floor of the municipal building, and I want to get it straight as
to whether or not you can use the opposite direction or, go from the first floor
of the municipal building into the <span class="locked">staircase——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Wait a minute. Now, let’s see here—try to correct it best
I can. Let’s say I am out there in that corridor there, and we’ll say—we’ll
just assume that that is the corridor there in the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, <span class="locked">now——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. And assume that the room we are in is the staircase room.
All right, anywhere you are on the first floor, or any of those floors you can
always go into those staircases, fire escapes, none of those are not locked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Except the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Except the basement where you come out, that’s right. None
of them are not locked, I am sorry, I got confused there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think that is right. You can go from the corridor into the
staircase on the first floor, because those doors do not lock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, once you get into the staircase on the first floor you
can go down into the basement and go through the basement door into the basement,
but you couldn’t come through the door from the basement because it
is locked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Yes, sir; on the weekends; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think that is straight now. You said there was another fire-escape
door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. One more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. That is the one where we were standing there, when—one
comes out of the building through the entrance right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. <span class="locked">Leads——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. On the Commerce side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Leads to the fire-escape stairway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Well, it is a fire-escape stairway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it operates exactly on—like the other one we are talking
about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. And it ends there on the first floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Doesn’t go down into the basement?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Doesn’t go down into the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see. So, that if you were on the first floor of the municipal
building that staircase that we are talking about on the Commerce Street side
does not lead you to the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The one we are talking about before is on the Main Street side
of the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Yes, sir; you see, you got to—you go in front of the hall, and
you have got a cross corridor there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Two corridors that cross each other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Yes, sir; and on each corridor there is a door comes from—winds
around and so it comes down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, only one of them goes to the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Only one goes to the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The only one that goes to the basement is the one we are talking
about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. That’s right, only one, that’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The other fire escape stops at the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. Stops at the main floor and do not go down into the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, all right, I think that it is clear. Now, has there been
any conferences between you, Mr. Servance, and any member of the President’s
Commission prior to this deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. No, sir; nobody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you consider that between this document number 5131 which
you identified and your deposition that we have the whole story about everything
you now know about this matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Servance</span>. That’s right, best of my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="EBERHARDT">TESTIMONY OF A. M. EBERHARDT</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of A. M. Eberhardt was taken at 2:40 p.m., on March 25, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Burt W. Griffin, assistant counsel of the President’s
Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me state for the record, and also for your advice and information,
my name is Burt Griffin and I am a member of the advisory staff of the
General Counsel’s office of the President’s Commission investigating the assassination
of President Kennedy. This Commission has been set up by virtue of
an Executive order of the President of the United States and a congressional
resolution. The Executive order is Order No. 11130, which was issued on
November 29, 1963, and the congressional resolution is Resolution No. 137.
As a result of these two official acts, the Commission has promulgated a set of
rules to conduct the proceedings, and in conformance with those rules and the
Executive order and the congressional resolution, I have been designated
to take a sworn deposition from you, Detective Eberhardt.</p>

<p>Now, the general area of the investigation of the Commission is to ascertain,
evaluate and report back to President Johnson on the facts relating to the
assassination of President Kennedy and the later murder of Lee Oswald.
In particular as to you, we are concerned about the events that led up to the
death of Lee Oswald and most particularly about Jack Ruby, but we are concerned
about anything else that you might have to offer the Commission that
you think is pertinent. The Commission is not an investigatory agency in the
sense that a grand jury is.</p>

<p>We don’t have any authority to prosecute for any crimes. The only crime
that could be committed in connection with this investigation that we can do
anything about is perjury, and our primary concern in this matter is frankly
one of national security and not prevention of crime. The most obvious thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
is to learn how we can prevent the kind of things that have happened, well,
since November 22, from recurring again, but it goes much further than that,
because there are matters that transcend simply the protection of the President,
there are problems, real problems of national security that are involved
in this, and there are worries about it that are involved, too, because whenever
you have the President murdered, you can’t exclude the possibility that
there is some political group or even nonpolitical group interested in killing
the President of the United States, and it is compounded when you find that
the man that is charged with the murder of the President himself dies.</p>

<p>So it becomes very important for us to learn what the truth is, and we want
to do this in a way that will encourage people to come forward and tell us
the truth, and if there are problems in connection with this, nobody can be
close to this without having some personal problems or personal involvement
in this thing, we want to try to do what we can to minimize these kinds of problems
for you and to encourage you to come forward with whatever you know
that may be of value to us.</p>

<p>Now, you in particular are appearing here as a result of a general request
which the General Counsel of the Commission made to Chief Curry. Under
the rules adopted by the Commission, you are actually entitled to a 3-day written
notice before any deposition is taken; however, the rules also provide that
you can waive the notice, and I will ask you now if you want us to provide you
with a written notice or if you are willing to waive that notice and go forward
with the deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. It is fine to go on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. You are also entitled to have an attorney here before
the Commission, and we do have many witnesses who come here with attorneys,
and you are not here now, I see, with counsel, but if you would like to have an
attorney, consult with one beforehand, we would be happy to adjourn at this
point and let you come back whenever you feel like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I don’t need any counsel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I will ask you, then, if you will raise your right hand and be
sworn. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you state your full name for the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. A. M. Eberhardt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you just have a first initial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No. August Michael.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. 706 East Farmers Road, Seagoville, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is Seagoville [spelling] S-e-a——</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. September 13, 1933.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I am a detective of police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been with the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Eight years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you assigned to any particular unit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Assigned to burglary and theft.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been with burglary and theft?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. About 2 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you and I talked for some time just prior to taking this
deposition, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, prior to my talking with you, has anybody else from the
Commission staff, as opposed to the Secret Service, one of the investigatory
agencies, has anybody from the Commission staff spoken with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I made some notes during our interview I want to dictate these
for the record. I wish you would listen to them carefully, and if there are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
any changes or corrections that you would like to make, I wish you would tell
me and we can straighten up the record on this.</p>

<p>I began talking with Mr. Eberhardt about how the FBI happened to interview
him on December 20, 1963, and he indicated that he believed that it was a
result of finding his telephone number in one of Jack Ruby’s notebooks or on
a scrap of paper. Mr. Eberhardt told me that he had changed his telephone
number and that the number which was actually in Jack’s phone book was not
the number that he had now. The reason for the change was that, out in
Seagoville, the telephone company became a member or a part of the regular
Dallas dialing district, and all of the telephone numbers in Seagoville were
changed, although there was no actual physical change of any telephone. He
also stated to me that he had come to know Jack Ruby in connection with his
work on the police force, that while he was a member of the vice squad and
while he has been with the burglary and theft division of the police department,
he has had occasion to visit Ruby’s nightclubs. Now, he said that, since he
has been with burglary and theft, which has been since early 1962, that he
saw—went into Ruby’s place almost every night when he was on the night
shift, and I asked him when he was last on the night shift, and he stated
that he was on the night shift the month of October. Mr. Eberhardt <span class="locked">also——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. That is going to be wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Speak to the reporter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I am just trying to think. I told—I was working 3 to 11
when the President got killed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. So that would be my night shift.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, during which shift did you go in to Ruby’s club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I would be working 3 to 11 shift in November, the month
that the President got killed, but I hadn’t seen him in November, and I had
worked days in October and I hadn’t seen him in October, so it would be
August when I would have been up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would it be September?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. September. I was working 3 to 11 when the President got
killed, because I was home and heard it on television and came on to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, did you ever visit Jack’s clubs on a social basis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how frequently would you visit them on a social basis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. In the 5 years I knew him, I was at the Vegas Club about
three times with my wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about the Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. We went up there once and she wouldn’t ever go back. She
wanted to see what it was like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How recently before the President was killed had you been
in the Vegas or Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Socially?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. It had been a long time, over a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And to continue dictating what Detective Eberhardt told me,
he stated that he regarded Jack Ruby as a source of information in connection
with his investigatory activities. I asked him in particular whether he remembered
any instances when Jack had been a source of such information, and he
stated that at one time Jack reported to him a female employee of his whom
he believed had been forging checks and also thought might be a source of
narcotics or drugs of some sort, and as a result of the information which Ruby
provided, a charge was filed against this girl.</p>

<p>Now, do you remember the name of the girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Not her true name. We handed her over to the forgery
bureau. She had some dangerous drugs. She was up under the name of
[deletion]. She never came back. We arrested her out of the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long ago was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. That was when I was working vice. Three years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you also stated that he informed on a fellow by the name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
of [deleted], who was wanted in connection with a white slavery charge.
Did you ever prosecute that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No. He came into town. He was already under indictment.
He told us that he was in town and where he was staying, which we like to
know. He was staying at the Baker Hotel, which was half a block away from
the Carousel, and he had heard one of the parking lot boys talking about
this Valentine being up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. And a search warrant was executed and a squad of officers
went in there and arrested them all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. That was when I was in vice, too. Two or three years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of information did he give you in connection with
burglary investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I investigated one burglary when his place was burglarized,
and I had several complaints at the Vegas Club from them as owners. Out on
the street, if we asked him about a particular person—we asked him about 8 or 9
months ago about a safe burglar [deleted]. He said he didn’t know him. If
he was on the street, he would come in and call it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was that burglary at Ruby’s place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I was working deep nights. He surprised the burglars in his
club and ran them out. I was in burglary and theft then for about a year or
year and a half. The case wasn’t assigned to me. I was the officer on the
scene, being the detective on duty at the time of the occurrence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this at the Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You say a year or year and a half. Do you mean a year or year
and a half ago or after you went on B. and T.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. A year ago from now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So that would have taken it to early 1963 or late 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack have a safe in his club at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No. It was a metal filing cabinet they pried, came in the
back door, came up the fire escape. He had closed the place, went to eat, went
back for his dogs, and when he came back, they were there, the burglars were
there. They didn’t get away with any of the loot, and they were later filed on,
I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did Jack do when he surprised them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. He called the police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he fight with them or anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No. They got out. He had a gun with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack have a safe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack ever talk with you about putting a safe into the
Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever hear of his talking with anybody about his installing
a safe in the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever talk with Jack about his practice with respect to
keeping money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. He always kept a large sum of money in his pocket, and I
talked to him several times about leaving that place at 2:30 or 3 o’clock in the
morning and driving home with it, but this was just one of his peculiarities.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he ever tell you what he did with it, where he kept it once
he got it home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know whether he used any banks or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No; I don’t know anything about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know whether Jack owned any real estate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack ever talk to you about the financial condition of his
club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. That was when it was a private club. Before he opened the
Carousel, see, it was a private club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that when it was known as the Sovereign Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes. And he said he was losing his shirt and he was going to
open it up to the public, and he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, since then, did he ever talk to you about how he was doing
financially?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes. Business was good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How recently did you talk to him about financial condition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Any time you would go up there and see him, you know, he
would come, you know, he liked to tell you business was good, he was doing
good, because he didn’t like his opposition, they were on the outs all of the time,
the two brothers, Weinsteins. They didn’t like each other at all. They didn’t
go to each other’s places. He would like to say he was doing good, getting some
of their business, he was doing good. He liked to talk about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know or did you ever hear him talk about Ralph Paul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you heard of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No; I haven’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I believe you also told me that you knew George Senator
and that George was a bartender for Jack at the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. He was doorman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He was doorman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. He took the money when the people came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know who was the person at the door, the ticket taker,
whatever you call it, at the Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Eva was; Eva Grant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Eva Grant; how would your describe her physically?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. She is in her forties, I would say, heavy set. She has long
hair. It was usually red tinted. Fair complected, nice, middle-aged looking
woman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You say she was heavy set? How heavy would you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I would say 155.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How tall would you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Any time I saw her, she had heels on and she would be five-six
or seven in heels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is she noticeably fat or obese?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No. She is just big boned, a big-boned woman. She is not
actually what you would call real fat. She is just heavy built.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know a woman by the name of Pauline Hall who worked
at the Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Not by name, I don’t. I might if I would see her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know of any fat, heavy-set woman who worked at the
Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know of any such person who worked at the Carousel
Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No. Eva had a good friend—I don’t know what her name
was—who she thought one time stole a ring off of her, who she was going to
call and make a report on it and called me and told me not to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever see the woman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I have never seen her. She was a very close friend of Mrs.
Grant, and that is why I dropped the investigation, and that is the only close
friend I have heard her speak of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall that woman’s name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. That was last year sometime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. To continue with this dictation of what Mr. Eberhardt told me
prior to starting this deposition, that he also stated that he knew a man named
Buddy King, who had worked for Jack, and apparently King had been down
on his luck and Jack had picked him up and given him a job for a while, and
that it was common practice for Jack to pick up these people, people of this
sort, and employ them for a short while.</p>

<p>Do you think Jack did this because he could get these people for low wages
or do you think that he did it out of the goodness of his heart?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. He liked show people like Buddy King—you know, he was
in the movies—and he put a picture up there with Our Gang Comedy. He liked
to be around people like that. Prizefighters, they would be up there now and
then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know any prizefighters up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes. I met a prizefighter that bounced for him one night, the
old heavyweight here in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Turman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes; Buddy Turman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is he the only one that hung around there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes; I take it back. You remember when this left-handed
lightweight fighting for Curtis Cokes, going to fight for the title, little, left-handed,
Muskegon, Mich.? He was down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. When Kenney Lane fought Curtis Cokes in Dallas, the night
after, he was up in the place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Kenney Lane fought Curtis Cokes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Kenney Lane fought Curtis Cokes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He came up to the place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. He came up to the place. He is top contender right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack say how he knew him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No. He just said, “There is Kenney Lane.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About how often do they have prizefights in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. They haven’t had one for quite a while now. They tried to
promote some, but they didn’t go over good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about amateur fights?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes; we have tried to build up with some smokers with the
Police Athletic League, and such as that. Had the Golden Gloves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About how often in the average year have they had the amateur
fights, that you know of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. They had 4 or 5 cards last year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who sponsored those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I don’t know who was sponsoring them, really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack have anything to do with those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No; huh-uh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack ever indicate to you any interest in them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I also asked Detective Eberhardt if he knew of anyone else whom
he knew from the police department, and he mentioned that his partner on the
vice squad, R. L. Clark, also got some useful information, but that Eberhardt
hasn’t worked with Clark since early 1962 when Detective Eberhardt was transferred
to burglary and theft.</p>

<p>Now, is there anything else that you would want to add to what I have just
dictated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that—are you satisfied that that is an accurate statement,
a report of what we talked <span class="locked">about——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Beforehand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you have given an interview to Agents Smith and Chapoton,
[spelling] C-h-a-p-o-t-o-n, of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on December 20,
1963, and you stated that, when you were on duty sometime between 3 and 11<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
p.m. on Friday night, November 22, that you recall seeing Jack Ruby on the third
floor between 6 and 7 p.m. Will you tell us how you happened to—how you
fix this as between 6 and 7 p.m.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I was working afternoons, usually go to eat at around 5:30 or
6, and I already had eaten when I got back in the office when I seen Jack, and
so make it around 7 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you actually in the office when you saw Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. He had stuck his head in our door and hollered at us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he come in and talk at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did he remain in the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Oh, 10 or 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who else was in the office with you at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Our whole—well, our shift was on. I don’t recall who actually
was in there, but Lieutenant Leonard’s shift was on at that time. That is who
I worked for at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Give me as many of the people as you recall who would have been
on that shift.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Let’s see. I wouldn’t know their days off, but I could tell
you the names of everybody on the shift.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Let’s have that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. C. A. Jones, S. Tuck, P. Dillehay, J. R. Johnston, C. T. Burney,
W. P. Posey, R. A. Standifer, M. Tuck. Lieutenant, it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is Lieutenant Leonard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes; there is some more that I just can’t—H. J. Bettes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How do you spell that last name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. [Spelling.] B-e-t-t-e-s. Correction on Posey. He was on
vacation. J. H. Boyd, that I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Those people that you have named, do you remember specifically
if any of them were in the office when Jack came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes; the lieutenant was there, I think Jones was there, I
think Tuck was there, and they were in and out and reporters in and out, you
know, it is hard to sit here and visualize who was standing there, and the
secretaries were there, but I don’t recall which were on duty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You have a number of rooms in your office; don’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. In our office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. We have three interrogation rooms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You have the main reception room, the interrogation rooms?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No, no; the only office that is closed off is the interrogation
rooms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As you walk into the office, you come into a room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. You come into an “L,” and then the room opens up for you.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, can you describe which room Jack came into?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. He opened our door and walked in about three paces and
just stood there and talked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he sit down at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No; he stood up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what do you remember him saying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. He came in and said hello to me, shook hands with me. I
asked him what he was doing. He told me he was a translator for the newspapers.
Of course, I knew that he could speak Yiddish. Had a notebook in
his hand, and he talked a little bit about that, and then he said that he brought
the coffee and sandwiches up for the reporters, corned beef sandwiches. He
said, “Nothing but kosher stuff is all I bring.” He talked a little bit about the
assassination of the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember him saying—what he said about the assassination?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. How terrible it was for it to happen in the city, and then he
left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he seem—how would you describe his state of emotion over
the Presidents death?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Well, he said that he—he called me by my middle name—he
said, “It is hard to realize that a complete nothing, a zero like that, could kill a
man like President Kennedy was.” He said that, “It is hard to understand how
a complete nothing,” that is what he referred to him as, “a complete nothing
could have done this,” and then he left, and then I didn’t notice where he went.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you remember anything else that was said in these 5
or 10 minutes that he was in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No; he just asked me how I was doing, how my wife and
children are, which he always did any time he seen anybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. <span class="locked">Now——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I was trying to recall about this lapel deal and give it a lot
of thought, and I can’t remember visually what he had on his lapel, but I do
remember him taking his notebook and hitting his lapel, and he said, “I am
here as a reporter,” and he took the notebook and hit like that. He had something
on his coat, but I can’t visualize now what it was. I did not get one of
his kosher sandwiches, either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You didn’t. Did he show them to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No; I never did ask the man anything about them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is it because of his statement about the kosher sandwiches that
you place the time as between 6 and 7 p.m.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Well, I had already eaten. That is why I placed the time
around there in the evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, could it have been as late as 10:30 or 11?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Oh, no; no. See, we get off at 11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know if there were Israeli newspaper or <span class="locked">Yiddish——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. There was a bunch of them running around there talking
that unknown tongue. I don’t know what they were saying. There were some
orientals; there was some French; there were several dialects running around
there that I didn’t know what they were talking about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, you saw Jack at a later time, also, didn’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, could it have been at this later time that Jack told you
about the kosher sandwiches?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I didn’t speak to him at the later time. That is the only
time I spoke to him. I just seen him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know, after Ruby killed Oswald, there were a number
of rumors that circulated as to how he got into the basement, and one of the
rumors was that he got in by the use of a press badge? Now, one thing we are
interested in here is tracing how these rumors might have gotten started. You
recall your actions after the assassination is that you might have described this
particular episode that you just told us about now about being an Israeli interpreter.
Do you recall that you mentioned that to anybody within the 24
hours after Ruby killed Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No; I didn’t. The first one I talked to about it was when
the FBI agents asked me about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, wasn’t it common for all of you people to be talking about
any contact that you had with Ruby on those 2 days?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. See, I wasn’t there. I was gone Sunday and Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. But I mean, even when you came back, wasn’t there a
lot of gossip, what-not, guys exchanging views?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Didn’t you somewhere between the time you actually saw Ruby
here and the time that you were interviewed by the agents, didn’t you talk to
somebody in the police department about your meeting Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes. We talked about him being up there in the office, and
being around the city hall like that and wondered how he got in the basement,
and then the only other thing I did on that was write a report to the chief of
police on some information given to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Off of the record here.</p>

<p>(Discussion off of the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We will go on the record on this. I have asked Mr. Hubert to
check in our files to see if we have got a copy of this report that you mentioned
that you gave to Chief Curry. Now, I don’t have any recollection that we have
it, and let me ask you now, if he doesn’t report back to me and say that we have
it, would you be good enough, when you go back to work today, to check where
a copy of this report is and provide it to us? I am going to ask you to clear
it with your superiors and everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I would like to see a copy of that. What did that report deal
with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. This was information given to me by a police reserve who I
know real well who was on duty at the time. He didn’t think anything about
telling anybody about it, and several days later he told me about it, about going
out to the hospital when Oswald was shot and talking to another reserve out
there, that he didn’t know his name, who said that he had seen or thought he
had seen a man walk down the ramp outside of the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was the reserve officer that gave you this information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. H. B. Holly, Jr. And as soon as he told me about it, I sat
down and wrote a “Dear Chief,” and gave it to my captain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have occasion yourself to talk to this unknown reserve
officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No; I didn’t. I talked to Holly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. Mr. Hubert indicated to me that we didn’t have a copy
of this report, and I would appreciate very much seeing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Okay. I will try.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember what you did in the period between the time
you saw Ruby, at which you estimated at 6 or 7 p.m., and when you saw him
later on at the press conference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I worked—I just worked my day out, and then they held us
over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you stay in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes. They had us on standby. I did paper work, caught up
on supplements. They held us over a little bit, and then we had the press conference.
When they brought Oswald in, we stood with him, myself and a couple
of other detectives.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You stood next, right next, to Oswald for the purpose of guarding
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And were you able to look out over the crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, where did you see Ruby in the crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. He was on the right-hand side of the room standing up on one
of the tables with a notebook and pencil in his hand, with all of the reporters and
cameramen out there. They were facing us. They were in the assembly room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who were the other people guarding?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. There was a whole line, a whole line in front of the showup.
I was standing about three people removed behind Oswald. I was standing behind
Oswald and the reporters were shooting questions at them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he seated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No; he was standing. We were all standing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You were able to look over his shoulder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Oh, yes; I had a full view of the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what other police officers were down there with
you guarding Oswald and looking out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Well, Mr. Wade was there; Chief Curry was there; Captain
King was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What other detectives were guarding Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Well, homicide detectives were there. I don’t know which
ones they were. The ones that, you know, were working on him, probably
Leavelle and his partner. Joe Cody was there. That is the only ones I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
remember. And there was some uniform men from the jail, I believe, there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you stay after Oswald left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Until they got him out. I didn’t have anything to do with
transporting him to or from the assembly room, but when he initially arrived
in the assembly room, they asked us to go up there more or less to keep the
reporters from making a rush for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you happen to go down to the assembly room in the
first place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. To hear the press conference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Out of curiosity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did any other men from your bureau go down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes; Cody is from my bureau, and he is the only one that
I remember being up there with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Did you stay in the press conference room after
the homicide people took Oswald out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did Chief Curry speak at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No; Henry Wade did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you recall anything that happened during Henry
Wade’s interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No; because when Oswald left, then all semblance of any
kind of order disappeared. They just, you know, come up around Henry Wade
and just <span class="locked">started——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember Ruby’s saying anything during this press
conference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No; I don’t remember seeing him again, either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember Henry Wade making any statement to the
effect that Oswald was a member of the Free Cuba Committee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I don’t remember too much of what the district attorney
said. There was so much written and heard about it, it is hard to differentiate
what Wade said from what I read in the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If Ruby had said something at this press conference, would
you have noticed it or heard it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I have heard that he had from other people, you know, rumors
around, but myself, I don’t remember he said anything. I heard he corrected
Mr. Wade on a question, is what I heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Is what I heard. I didn’t stay for the entire conference.
I was at liberty to go home. When they had me go up there and guard Oswald,
as soon as he left, I was at liberty to go home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you leave this conference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. About 5 minutes after he left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you and Cody leave together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you sign out of the building or anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No; we don’t sign out. I just left, got in my car and went
home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Cody remain in there after you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I don’t know. I lost him in the shuffle. I stood over there
by Johnny, the news reporter up there in the pressroom at the city hall, is who
I stood by while the conference was going on. He asked a couple of questions.
I couldn’t tell you what questions he asked. No; there was no semblance of
order. Those reporters just holler out anything that comes in their mind,
and whoever shouts the loudest is whoever gets the answer, is how it works.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If Ruby had said something while you were in there, would
you have been close enough to Henry Wade or to Ruby to have heard it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I don’t know where Ruby was, so I couldn’t answer that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, you said at this press conference you saw Ruby standing
<span class="locked">back——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Back on a table?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Right</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don’t understand it, now, when you say that you don’t know
where Ruby was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. As soon as Oswald left is when the press conference began,
and when Oswald left, they all came running up to the front. There was
great disorder. When Oswald left, all of the reporters was at liberty to do
what they wished, and they all came up to the front, and I didn’t see Jack
Ruby after Oswald left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. I want you to be an artist here. Can you draw the
assembly room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Okay. Here is the main door. This is the stage back here for
a showup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. It is raised. All right. And then through here you have
an alleyway, a little hallway, and then down through here is a walkway. Now,
through here are fixed tables that run length to the wall, stationary, all of
the way down, both sides.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Will you mark those with a “T” or a “Table” or something like
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Okay. Now, they were all stationary here. Over here is
a desk that the showup lieutenant uses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. With a microphone here. Now, Oswald was brought in
through here. All of the reporters were warned by the chief of police that,
if they rushed to the front, he would be taken out and no questions would be
asked or answered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. When Oswald came in there, where did he get
planted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. He came up to the center of the stage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Put an “X” or a circle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. He would be there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you write “Oswald” there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there people on either side of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes; I was on this side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, the people, there weren’t other prisoners but there were
other detectives?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. All of the way to the desk, all of the way to the door. Of
course, I couldn’t see too much over here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Will you put an “X” where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Right about here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And would you mark your initials or something there? Okay.
Now, were there any people in between you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. This way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Between you two. How many officers were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. The best I remember, two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Will you put two little circles in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Two “X’s.” Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Now, they left some cameramen up here in front of this table,
see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. And they were lined up all through in here. They were in
the kneeling position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. You are indicating, in between the tables where you and
Oswald were, why there were a bunch of news photographers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And they were all there <span class="locked">in——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Aisleway, all news photographers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That leads to the back of the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Okay. And the rest of them back here stood up on these
tables. When the front tables got full, they all stood up, and Ruby was over
here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Will you put “Ruby” on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Then they proceeded to ask him questions, take his picture,
what have you, and somebody, the chief, I don’t remember which one of the
chiefs, said, “All right. Take him out.” And they took him out, and I remained,
and when they took him out, here they all come.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After Oswald was taken out, were there any people still standing
up on those tables?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No; they got off, and, of course, Henry Wade was up here at
the desk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mark “Henry Wade” there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Then they all run for him, and you couldn’t see Wade for the
reporters around him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Were the reporters between you and Henry Wade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So the reporters had their back to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, could you hear the questions that were being asked by the
reporters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I could hear most of them; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could you hear Henry Wade’s answers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there any difference in the way that you could hear Henry
Wade’s answers as opposed to the way you could hear the questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Well, the questions were coming from all over the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Henry Wade speaking through a microphone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. They kept hollering for him to turn on the microphone. At
first, he hadn’t gotten it turned on, but they hollered at him, and he turned it on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there any substantial difference between your ability to
hear <span class="locked">Wade——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As opposed to your ability to hear the reporters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there any times when there were people speaking when you
couldn’t hear them, reporters asking questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No; they shout. They shout from the crowd. Very ill-mannered
people, the way they conducted that thing. There is no—I mean they
don’t have any concern for any of their other people or not. It is every man
for himself. They just run, and if they run over one of their own, they do,
that is all, and it is mass confusion. Whenever they left these tables and what
have you, they just come up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to mark this, step over here and get a pen. While
I am marking this particular document, I would like for you to look at the report
of your interview and read it over and then I am going to ask you if there are
any additions or corrections you want to make.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Did you want me to deliver that “Dear Chief” copy to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If you would, send it over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to mark for <span class="locked">identification——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Let me make you a better picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are going to go down in history. A thousand years from
now, they are going to look at this and say, “That is what Eberhardt did.”
I have marked this diagram that you have made of the assembly room Exhibit
No. 5025, and I have labeled it “Police Assembly Room, Oswald Press Conference.”
Now, this is the diagram that you have just finished drawing, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you sign that and date it? [Pause.] You are going to
mess up the historians. The year is—1267, that is your police number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I thought you were writing the year on there. Now, I am
going to also mark for identification the report of Smith and Chapoton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I don’t like that, I mean this part here, I mean they didn’t
get this exactly right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Let us change it. Let me mark it, “Dallas, Texas,
Detective Eberhardt, 3-25-64, Exhibit 5026.” Now, would you look at that,
and what corrections or changes do you want to make?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. This part, asked me how come Jack had my phone number.
My baby, my youngest one, when she was <span class="locked">born——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. He knew I was a Catholic. He was Jewish, which has
nothing to do with it. It is a christening card, not a present. I don’t know
if you know anything about our religion. When a child is christened, it is
pretty big in our religion. He wanted to send her a christening card, and
that is when I invited him to my house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. That was about 2 weeks after the baby was born.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was the baby born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. May 8.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Wouldn’t this be an accurate statement, “Because this was the
day that Eberhardt’s child was born, Ruby wanted to send the child a christening
card”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why don’t you cross it out and put “christening card”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, put your initials there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. And I invited him to come out to the house and see the
baby when she was christened. He had never been to my home nor I to his.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there anything <span class="locked">else——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That you want to change on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there anything else that you think might be of value to the
Commission, either in connection with the Oswald <span class="locked">killing——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Well, this part down here. I don’t know if anybody has mentioned
to you about this or not, but Officer Mullinax, he talked to me a long
time when this boy got killed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did that occur?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. It was in the summer 2 years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. 1961 or 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No; 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. An officer was shot to death in a hotel. There were no witnesses,
except the man that shot him. The man that shot him was not indicted.
There were no witnesses. I went up to Jack’s one night, and he talked to me
one night about it, and he went to the boy’s funeral. I don’t know if that gives
you any idea of how Ruby’s mind is, but it is unusual in our profession to have
a man show up at a funeral. You would just have to draw your own conclusions
as to why he would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, Mullinax was on the vice squad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And Jack tried to be very friendly with all of the members of
the vice squad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. He was friendly with everybody. If he knew you, he would
say hello to you. If he didn’t know you, he was going to try to meet you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The vice squad would probably be one of the first to close his
place down if there was any problem?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Liquor board and the vice squad, that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You feel that you know Jack well, don’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes and no. I know the man from seeing him up there,
but I have never rode in any car with him, never had him at my home, but
I know him from seeing him time after time after time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you seen people who are like Jack, enough people of Jack’s
background that you think you could judge his character?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. We get around a lot of characters in this business, and he
was one of them. He was a little more unique than some of the others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How was he more unique?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Everybody knew he had a bad temper. He had a reputation
in town as being a streetfighter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. If an officer got in trouble around his place, he would help
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you think he was the kind of a man who was capable of
being nice to people for his own benefit because, there would be some personal
interest or profit in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I don’t know. He—I couldn’t see what he could—he never
asked us to do anything. We arrested people out of his place. He didn’t get
mad at us, say anything to us, “Don’t arrest her.” In fact, he told us about
it. She was about to start on his show at the time that we arrested her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that the girl on the forgery charge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you think Jack was the kind of man who was capable of
keeping a secret of being engaged in activities that other people might not
know about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Certainly. I believe, if he didn’t want us to know something,
he wasn’t going to tell us. If he did something illegal, I wouldn’t look
for him to come tell us; we would have to catch him, if he was doing something,
but most people are that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He was an outgoing guy, he talked about a lot of things, but
was he also the kind of guy that was capable of keeping things pretty close to
the vest if he wanted to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Yes. Like I say, going up there to check his old place, he
knew me as well as anyone. He has walked past me and not even seen me.
He was just in another world. He would walk past and stop and say hello and
say, “I didn’t see you,” and another time he would see you two blocks away and
run you down and say hello. He liked people in his place; he liked names
to introduce you to people, and that is why he had somebody around there.
Like when he had Buddy King around there, and after he got through telling
me who he was, I thought he was a big star, after Jack got through telling me
he had been in the movies. He is just like that. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear any reports prior to the time that he shot Oswald
that he was a homosexual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No, I hadn’t heard anything. In fact, I thought he was a
ladies’ man, the way he talked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there anything else about this Mullinax thing, incident, that
seems significant to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Just the fact that he went to the funeral, talked about this
fellow getting away with it, that something should be done, more or less that
we just couldn’t do anything about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have there been any other police officers killed in the line of
duty, other than Tippit and Mullinax, since you have been on the force?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack—was Jack personally acquainted with Mullinax?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. He knew Mullinax, had seen him. He had been up at the
place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would Mullinax have had an opportunity to visit Jack’s place
on a regular basis in connection with his business on the police force?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I wouldn’t say that Jack Ruby knew him as good as he knew
some of the other officers, no, but Mullinax had been up there several times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who were—at the time that Oswald was killed, who were the
officers on the force outside of yourself that Ruby knew the best, would you
say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I don’t know who he knew the best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. From your own estimation, who did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I don’t know all that he knew. He knew just about everybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you think of any ones in particular that you think he knew
quite well?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I have never seen him out any place with any officers; I
have never seen him outside of his place with any officers; I have never seen him
in a car or restaurant or anything like that with any policemen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, do you feel that there were other people on the force who
knew Ruby better than you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Well, I have been there 8 years. I don’t know even how
long Jack Ruby has been in Dallas. I have been in Dallas a little longer than
8 years. I imagine that some of the older officers knew him when he had
another place here. He used to have another place down on Ervay Street. That
is before I got on the police force.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don’t think I have any more questions. Do you have anything
else that you want to offer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No, nothing that I can think of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. I will bring that report down to you tomorrow and leave it
for you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I would appreciate that. If you would, also sign this statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Any place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Any place and date it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Have you got a card?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Pardon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. Have you got a card?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No, I don’t. I will show you my identification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eberhardt</span>. No. I was just going to write it down. In case you weren’t
here, I was going to leave it for you.</p>

<h2 id="EVANS">TESTIMONY OF SIDNEY EVANS, JR.</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of Sidney Evans, Jr., was taken at 2:10 p.m., on March 31,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of
the President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Mr. Sidney Evans, Jr. Mr. Evans,
my name is Leon D. Hubert, I am a member of the advisory staff of the President’s
Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy. Under the provisions
of the Executive Order No. 11130, dated November 29, 1963, and Joint
Resolution of Congress No. 137, and the rules of procedure adopted by the
Commission in conformance with the Executive order and the joint resolution,
I have been authorized to take the sworn deposition from you. I state to you
now that the general nature of the Commission’s inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate
and report upon the facts relating to the assassination of President Kennedy
and subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald. In particular, as to you,
Mr. Evans, the nature of the inquiry is to determine what facts you know
about the death of Oswald and any other pertinent facts you may know about
the general inquiry, particularly as to the whereabouts of Jack Ruby around—on
the morning of November 24. Now, did you receive a letter from the General
Counsel of the President’s Commission, Mr. J. Lee Rankin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Such a letter was addressed to you and apparently miscarried
somehow, but in any <span class="locked">case——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Might have went to those apartments. See, I was working out
of Houston, and they cut the run and I had to transfer, and that was the reason
that the three of us was sharing the apartment there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me state this to you. Under the rules adopted by the
Commission, you are entitled to a 3-day written notice prior to the taking of
the deposition, and it was sent out by mail, but apparently hasn’t reached you.
The rules of the Commission also provide that you can waive that notice if
you want to do so, and I will ask you now if you are willing to waive that 3-day
notice and let us take your deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. It don’t matter. I want to get it over with. I done lost too much
already.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, would you stand and raise your right hand so that
I can administer the oath? Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you please state your name, Mr. Evans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Sidney Evans, Jr.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Thirty-seven, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you reside, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Retired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. 2205 Marvel. M-a-r-v-e-l.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Irving, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Irving, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Uh-huh, that <span class="locked">is——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Line driver for Red Ball Motor Freight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been so employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Since 1958.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Six years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In November of 1963, where did you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. My home is in Houston, but I was still at the Marsalis Apartments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where is that located, that Marsalis Apartments?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. 232 Ewing, I believe, or, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you say 223 South Ewing Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What apartment did you have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. 204.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I think you said you shared that with somebody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Two other drivers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who are they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Jack Scritchfield and Malcom Slaughter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long had you been living there with these men, sharing
that apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I believe I only stayed there 2 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, it was a stopoff place on your runs that you
make as a driver, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, you see, they have a bunkhouse, and we were staying in
the bunkhouse, but the company said that we can’t do that no more, and our
families were still in Houston, so, we had to have a place to sleep when we
were in a town, and sometimes wouldn’t be there 1 day a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you estimate that you actually shared this apartment with
these other two gentlemen for about 2 months?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Two months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how often, or how many times, put it that way, during
those 2 months prior to November 24, 1963, did you actually stay overnight
or stay in the daytime in this apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. I don’t believe it was once a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About once a week? So, about eight or nine times, you think,
during this period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Something like that. About the only time we would be there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
is if we came in Saturday, we would be there Saturday, or Saturday night
and run out Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall being at that apartment on November 24, 1963, the
Sunday after the President was assassinated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That was the morning Oswald was shot? Yes, all three of us
was there that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have occasion that day to see a man by the name of
Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I guess it was him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, tell us how <span class="locked">you——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, you <span class="locked">see——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Came to think it was him or guess it was him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, see, the church I have been going to is over in Irving,
and they had one, I found out, over there on Marsalis, Catholic Church there
in Oak Cliff, and I thought they had 10 o’clock mass, but I went and they had
a 9 and 11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. So, I come back to the apartment at—well, it was just a little
bit before 10, and just as I got out of the car a fellow come out of the laundry,
and he had his—both hands with laundry in them, and I stepped out of my
car, and I kind of waited for him to go on up, and he kind of waited for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How close did you get to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, we wasn’t—right then only about 15 feet, something like
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How was the man dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. He was—had on a T-shirt, pants and T-shirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No hat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No hat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you said he had some laundry in his hands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he live in that same apartment house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I went up the stairs first, and he went up behind me,
and we went up the first flight. I figured he lived on the first flight. I didn’t
know where he lived, so, when we went around and went up the second flight
he was right behind me, and I said, “How are you this morning?” And he
ignored me like I didn’t—well, somebody going along with both arms full of
laundry, I would open the door, because he was going up on the same floor, so,
when he didn’t speak with me, I said, “Well, heck with you.” So, I walked on
and he went in 207 there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He went in apartment 207? Was this laundry he had already
clean, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, they had a—they’ve got a washer and dryer in the basement
in the apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was coming up from the washateria?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he went into apartment 207?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes. And, so, I went in. Two buddies were up, so, we ate breakfast
and I went back to church at 11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you had gone to try to catch the 10 o’clock mass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; but didn’t have at 10. Had to go at 11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At what time did you leave your apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. I left about a quarter of 11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean the first time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. About a quarter until 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Quarter to 10? And you got there and found out mass was at
9:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; it was 9. Just getting over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just getting over, so you just came on back to the apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long was it between the time you left your apartment
and—until the time you got back on the first round when you found <span class="locked">out——</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, it only takes about six or seven blocks from the apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were driving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Driving. It takes less <span class="locked">than——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you figure about 10 o’clock or a little before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. A little before 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, have you subsequently seen pictures of Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. I have seen pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you seen him in person since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That is the only time I ever seen him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had never seen him before that date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Never since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think that the man you saw that morning that you have
just described was the same man that you have seen in the pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, I really didn’t get a close look. All I know, he went in that
apartment, and it is my understanding he had a roommate, but it might have been
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I wanted to ask is whether or not the pictures that you
have seen in the newspapers since of a person now known as Jack Ruby was
the same man, in your opinion, that you saw with the laundry in his hands at
about 10 o’clock on November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, it could be. I mean, kind of—didn’t have real thick hair
on top.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I show you a series of pictures here, which for purposes
of identification I am marking on the back as follows, “Dallas, Texas, March 31,
1964. Exhibit No. 5122, deposition of Sidney Evans, Jr.,” and signing my name
to it, and in order that the record may show that we are both talking about the
same document, I will ask you to put your name under mine, after which, I will
ask you some questions about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I will ask you to turn the document over and look at those several
photos there of a man and ask you if that is the man you saw carrying the
laundry on the morning of November 24, at about 10 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, it looks like him. Of course, he didn’t have on nothing but
a T-shirt, white T-shirt when I saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; what I was thinking about, his <span class="locked">face——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, you know, I just looked over my shoulder. He was coming
up the stairs there behind me, and I said, “How are you this morning?” and
<span class="locked">he——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I take it that you looked at him several times, that is to
say, you looked at him when you first saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. I didn’t really look at him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then what did you do? Offer to open the <span class="locked">door——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. I just, you know, I spoke to him, and I—he was coming up the
same floor I was going up and I never paid much—in fact, <span class="locked">I——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At sometime you must have mentioned to somebody that you
thought you had seen this man on that Sunday, and that he was Jack Ruby.
Do you recall how that came about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, one of these buddies there, he told some newspaperman a
bunch—that he told them all about that when I wasn’t even there at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean at the time that he told the story?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. He told them all about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We are talking about now, Malcom Slaughter, aren’t we?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had told Slaughter that you thought that man you had seen
was Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. After we ate and I went back to the 11 o’clock mass, and it was
close to 12 o’clock when I got back to the apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. And just as soon as I opened the door these guys told me Oswald
had been shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. And so, then, it wasn’t long before 1 o’clock Life Magazine, and—man,
they was out there taking picture, and newspapers, and they were taking
pictures of the apartment and interviewing different people there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, it was at that time that you told Mr. Slaughter that you
thought you had seen Ruby that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes; I told him what happened there and the guy had went in
that apartment there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know his roommate, I think you mentioned something
about a roommate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. I understand the papers said there were two of them staying there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you don’t know of your own knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you ever seen the man who was supposed to be his roommate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. In fact, we was not in there, and sleeping in the daytime mostly
when we was there, so I really don’t know anyone there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Anyhow, this man that you saw, who you think might have been
Ruby, you never had seen him before nor have you seen him after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your testimony is that this document identified as Exhibit
5122, looks like him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But that he had on a T-shirt instead of a tie and <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then did he have a hat on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see his hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, it was kind of thin there down the middle. That looks
a little darker than what I remembered. Seemed like he was sort of grayish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How tall a man was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. He was a lot shorter than I was, five something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How tall are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Six.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are 6 foot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say 5 foot what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Five six <span class="locked">or——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What sort of build?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Stout and husky.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How—powerful looking man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. <span class="locked">Well——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Strong looking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you anything else that you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. That is all I know. Well, I know Slaughter told me that he’s
seen him dressed up not long after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did I understand you to say that Mr. Slaughter made some
comment about this man known as Jack <span class="locked">Ruby——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, they told me he did. I don’t know whether he did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Said that he—not long after I had left and went back to church,
he said a man had—dressed up, and walked by our apartment, and he spoke to
him, or something, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say that he thought it was Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. They said they thought it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did they say they had seen him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, if it was him it was somewhere right at 11 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did he tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. After we got back, found out what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, told you on that same day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you told him that you thought you had seen Ruby earlier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
when he was carrying in laundry, he told you that he thought he had seen him
dressed up a little later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Uh-huh, that was after Oswald was shot, and they was out there
taking pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever advise the FBI agent that you had seen Ruby
around the apartment, although you did not know him personally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No, sir; I never did. The only time I saw him was that one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If it was Ruby? Right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Right. There was a landlady there, after that was all over
there, she told us that—well, in fact, these two guys that I room with had rented
the apartment, and I was out of town, and called me long distance and wanted to
know if I wanted to share it with them, because it was pretty expensive for two
men, and no more than we stayed there—I said, well, I had to stay somewhere,
and had to have a phone so that the company could call me. Something that
you—that they require is that you have to have a telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the landlady?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. She said during the summer months he would climb up on the
roof and sunbath up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who? Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Ruby, <span class="locked">whatever——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is her name? Do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; I don’t, but they moved a week or two after that. It seemed
like there was somebody interviewing them—it was a young man and his wife.
They moved out in Irving some place, but I don’t know where they moved to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean that is the third partner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; that is the landlady or the landlord and his wife, or the people
that rented the apartments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you say they moved and went to live in Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Somewhere, and said he bought them a place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, they don’t manage the apartment any more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. I guess it was about 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know their names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; see, these two friends of mine, they had rented the apartment,
and they had talked to the landlady and actually only supposed to be two
people staying in there. In fact, they would be—I would pay them my share
and they would pay the note.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know where Slaughter lives now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Well, he still lives in Houston, and they have given up the
apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, they have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Too expensive for two of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what his address is in Houston, or how he could
be reached? Well, he works for the same company that you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the Red Ball Motor Freight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Red Ball Motor Freight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where is it located in Houston, the main office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. 4000–4004 Irving Street, Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Irving Boulevard, Houston, Tex. Now, I think you have given
the name of the other man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Scritchfield. Of course, he <span class="locked">didn’t——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Scritchfield?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know where he is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. He is here in Dallas. I mean, he is staying up here. I don’t
<span class="locked">know——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He could be reached through your company, too, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Isn’t nothing that he knows about it. The only one would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
Malcolm, and he said he seen a man who was dressed up that looked like him
that he spoke to outside the apartment there. I think he went down to get a
letter or something, or check the mail, or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who did? Slaughter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had Slaughter indicated that he knew Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No; he didn’t know him. Just like I was, just stayed there maybe
one day a week, you know, <span class="locked">and——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, all right; I think that’s it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Didn’t know anyone there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, have you been interviewed prior to today by any member
of the Commission’s staff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No, sir; I believe there was a Mr. Page, or something—somebody——</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. FBI man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. Talked to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am talking about a member of the advisory staff of the Commission
itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, prior to the commencement of this interview—I mean this
deposition, there was a short interview between you and me. Did anything occur
during that interview which we have not brought out in the deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think that is all, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. They want one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Miss Laidrich, at the end of each of these depositions let there
be a statement to the effect that Mr. Jackson—why don’t you dictate it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Let the record show that Bruce Carlin and his wife, Karen
Bennett Carlin, have made it known at this time to the interrogator representing
the Warren Commission that each of them would like a copy of their deposition
in this matter, that at this time each is financially unable to pay for said
deposition and reserves the right to obtain a copy of said deposition at some
later date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. My name is Leon Hubert. I am a member of the advisory staff
of the General Counsel of the President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Under the provisions of Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963,
the Joint Resolution of Congress No. 137, and the rules of procedure adopted
by the Commission, in conformance with the Executive order and the joint
resolution, I have been authorized to take a sworn deposition from you, Mr.
Carlin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
I state to you now that the general nature of the Commission’s inquiry is
to ascertain, evaluate, and report upon the facts relative to the assassination
of President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>In particular as to you, Mr. Carlin, the nature of the inquiry today is to
determine what facts you know about the death of Oswald, and any other
pertinent facts you might know about the general inquiry, particularly concerning
conversations you had with Mr. Ruby on the 23d and 24th, and your
knowledge concerning a telegram by which your wife received $25 from Mr.
Ruby.</p>

<p>Now Mr. Carlin, I think you have appeared here today by virtue of a letter
addressed to you by Mr. J. Lee Rankin, General Counsel for the President’s
Commission; is that correct, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you received that, or did you receive that more than
3 days ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, would you stand, and I will administer the oath.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you state your name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Bruce Ray Carlin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old are you, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Twenty-three</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. 1312 Fairmont, Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. <span class="locked">Well——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. At this time for other address purposes, will you tell us the
name of your father?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. H. T. Carlin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Where does he live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Route 13, Box 258, Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you presently occupied, Mr. Carlin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I am not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What has been, generally speaking, your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I am a salesman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You sell any particular product?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes. Except for one job where I worked for a greeting card
company, I sell sundries like drugs, hair sprays and headache remedies.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What companies have you worked with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. The Blue Bonnet Drug Co. in Arlington, Big State Mercantile
in San Antonio, and Motel Drug Service in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Mr. Carlin, you were present during the deposition of
your wife just within the last hour and a half?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I want to cover those areas, if possible, in this way, by asking
you if you have any other versions of what she said and testified to on the
various points involved. I think in that way we can save time. In other
words, if you would prefer, of course, I can go through it, but since you were
here, and if it is agreeable to your counsel, we can get at it that way.</p>

<p>Did you hear her say anything which, to your knowledge, you would disagree
with, and I don’t mean by that of course to put either of you in a position of
not saying the truth, but just simply that it is a recognition that witnesses
sometimes see things differently than others in complete good faith on the
part of both witnesses, you understand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any variations that you saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. [To Mr. Jackson.] May I ask, at the time that I talked to you,
did you make some kind of notes or is that what you are doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I was taking notes of the whole proceedings. Let me ask
you, on November 22, 1963, Karen said she heard about the shooting of the
President from Andrew Armstrong. Who called and stated that the Carousel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
would be closed that night? I think you indicated to me that at the time you
or maybe possibly you and she heard about it in some other way prior to that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I myself misunderstood the question—that is correct, but what
I thought she said was the way she heard that Oswald was killed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. All right, to your knowledge, how did she learn that Oswald
was killed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I was watching television and I don’t remember the program,
but a news bulletin interrupted the program and said a man by the name of
Ruby, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I don’t remember whether it said Jack or it said Ruby, a Dallas
nightclub owner, had attempted to assassinate Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassinator
of John F. Kennedy, and I made the statement, “I bet they mean Ruby.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. You made the statement to whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Karen. I said, “I bet they mean Ruby.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Why did you make this statement, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Jackson, may I ask him—I have no objection whatsoever
to your asking any questions, but I think perhaps for the sake of the record,
it would be better if I ask them, and then when we finish asking him, you
absolutely have the right to go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I was just trying to help you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I really don’t recall if it said Jack Ruby or not. I don’t know
what made me say, “I bet that is Ruby,” but I know the announcer on TV
seemed not to be sure, and said that this was not verified yet. And only a
few minutes later the phone rang and it was Tammi True who asked if I
had seen television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you speak to her yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes, I picked the phone up and she said, “Were you watching
television?” And I said, “Yes.” She said, “Did you know Jack Ruby just
killed Oswald?” And I said, “I just made that statement to Karen, I bet
that is what the man meant.” The only reason that I can think of that I said,
“I bet that is Jack Ruby,” is the fact that he may have said Jack Ruby, or
maybe a man by the name of Ruby running a Dallas strip joint. I think that
is the way he said it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case, what you want to tell now is that you differ with
your wife’s recollection of how she learned of the shooting of Oswald in that
you yourself saw it on television and remarked to her that at least it could
have been Jack Ruby, and then it was confirmed by the call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. This is what she said, except the fact she forgot that Tammi
True had called. I don’t think she even said in her statement a while ago
except for the fact that she was thinking she had seen it on television. Of
course, we all saw it so many times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, Mr. Jackson, do you want to pursue any further?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you any other aspects of the matter that you would like
to comment upon relative to your wife’s testimony first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. A number of times there were a few things, very minor, which
a person’s memory might be—mine is failing me. There are a few things that
were said that I did not know about, that she mentioned. But this is because
I was not always at the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I mean to do by this is to simply ask you this. So far
as you have heard it and except in the way you have corrected it, your version
of the role you played in the things you did and the things you said and
the things you heard is about the same as your wife’s, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. There are two more things that I can think of right now, and
let me state both of them. One is concerning the rent, and one is the fact that
I talked to him, which she stated she didn’t know what we were saying. But
I talked to him in the parking lot that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Take one at a time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Concerning the parking lot conversation on the phone. She
came back to the table in Colony Club and was rather upset about the fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
Jack talked to her that way, and it made me a little upset, and I said I will call
him next time. And I called him from the parking lot, and he said, “Bruce, that
girl works for me, and she gets paid on a certain day.” And I think it was
Mondays. But the way I remember it, there were—I mean Sundays, I am
sorry—but there were times when they went over to the next day before they
got paid. He said, “She works for me and she is to get paid at a certain time
and I don’t owe the girl anything.”</p>

<p>I said, “I realize that, Jack, but we need the money to get back.” And he
said, “Well, I’ve got some people here and I can’t come down right now.” And
then he said, “I will just tell the attendant at the parking lot to give you all
some money. Let me speak to Karen or to Little Lynn,” I believe is the way
he said it, and I handed the phone to her, as she said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you spoke to him, were you asking simply for money to
get back, or for money to pay rent and buy groceries and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. At that time we were asking for money to get back. Not working
steadily, because my job requires a good car and mine was out of commission,
at times this man that I worked for with the Motel Drug Service, which
promised me a good job in the future, would come by and pick me up to
help me. And one day he might pay me a little bit of money to get along on,
and I never knew when I was going to get any, so all we were interested in at
the time was getting home. When I gave the phone to her, she stated we
needed the money for rent and groceries.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You heard that yourself? You heard her say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I do not recall whether she said that at that time. As far as
the money going for rent and groceries, because I didn’t know that I would have
to remember, and in fact I talked to Mr. Tom Thomas about it, because somebody
from the, some authorities, somebody from the FBI or Secret Service had
called to clear up a number of these things on the phone. In fact, they called
almost in the middle of the night, and I wouldn’t tell them anything. And he said,
“Well, if you are not sure who you are talking to, hang the phone up and call
me in the office in Dallas,” and I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which night was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I have no idea. We had just come home and the phone rang,
and I don’t really even remember the man’s name. But I called him back at
his office so I would know who I was talking to. It was one of the men who
had talked to her, I believe. I don’t recall his name, but at the time I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he want to talk about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. A number of questions which we had both already answered.
But he wanted to get them clear again. And then I don’t recall, but for some
reason somebody had called up at one time or another which caused us to call
Mr. Thomas. I was trying to keep my name, because of my family’s respectability,
out, and I wanted Mr. Thomas, who also worked for the same company
my father did, and I didn’t want him brought into it if I could help. And he
said they were either going to subpoena him to the trial or get a statement from
him. And I called him to tell him this.</p>

<p>Then I mentioned something about the rent. When I took the place I paid
3 weeks in advance, and then maybe I would go a week and then I would pay
the week before and a week ahead. There was nothing, there was no particular
date that I ever paid the rent. Sometimes ahead and sometimes I was behind.
I do not know for sure that the $25 that we asked for went for rent at that time
or whether we kept it and paid it when it was due, or whether it went for groceries
or medicine, which we both needed.</p>

<p>But to make a long story short, I presume the reason she said rent and groceries
was those were the two main factors that we needed to exist. All I am
trying to clear up is the fact that I am not sure that I gave the landlord money
for the rent at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you concur in your wife’s statement that her request to Ruby
on the 24th was not made solely for the purpose of rent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now did you actually hear her conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And she mentioned rent and groceries?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. It seems to me she said something like rent, groceries and other
things, just as you would say everybody else. In other words, we needed
money to exist until she could get the rest of her check.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Carlin, the purpose of this call to Mr. Ruby was, as you
have stated it, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were not asked by anyone to make this call, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. That’s correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No one suggested to you other than your wife, of course, and
Ruby himself, that this call be made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Insofar as Ruby suggested it be made, he didn’t suggest anytime,
as far as you were concerned, that it be made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. If he said this, I didn’t hear him saying it to her on the phone.
She did ask me to call, I believe, once, maybe twice, before we found the money
was there. Just as soon as we found <span class="locked">out——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember how you all decided to call Ruby on the 24th
when you did call him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes. The fact that he said to call, and when we got up, she said
that we should call, and then after we heard of Oswald’s death, I think just a
few minutes, I asked if the money had come in, and they said no, and I think she
called and found out later that the money had come in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But I mean, the time of the call to Ruby was not planned or
fixed in anyway? It was completely gratuitous?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. When we woke up, we called him. We slept late that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No time had been set prior to calling him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Carlin, have you been interviewed by any members of the
President’s Commission other than myself today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I suppose we did have what might be considered to be a little
interview in some conversation in the hall. Do you recall anything that was
said in the hall which has not been brought out in your deposition and your
wife’s deposition which I understand you have adopted with the amendments
that have been made? In other words, I am trying to ask you if there is anything
that we talked about that hasn’t been put in the record, because if it hasn’t
we ought to get it in there now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I understand, but I cannot think of anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Mr. Jackson, have you anything that you would like to
question your client, Mr. Carlin, about, or any statement you wish to make, or
observation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That being the case, I think that is all.</p>

<h2 id="KAREN_CARLIN">TESTIMONY OF KAREN BENNETT CARLIN</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of Karen Bennett Carlin was taken at 3:05 p.m., on April 15,
1964, at the Post Office Building, Fort Worth, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr.,
assistant counsel of the President’s Commission. Mrs. Carlin was accompanied
by her attorney, Mr. Alfred J. Jackson, Jr., and by her husband, Mr. Bruce Carlin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Karen Bennett Carlin. Let the record
show that Mrs. Carlin is accompanied by her husband, Mr. Bruce Carlin, and
by Mr. Alfred J. Jackson, Jr., attorney at law, in the firm of Tuchin &amp; Jackson,
suite 705, Fair Building, Forth Worth 2, Tex., who is representing Mrs. Carlin.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carlin, my name is Leon Hubert. I am a member of the advisory staff
of the General Counsel of the President’s Commission. Under the provisions of
Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, the Joint Resolution of Congress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
No. 137, and the rules of procedure adopted by the Commission, in conformance
with the Executive order and the joint resolution, I have been authorized to
take a sworn deposition from you, Mrs. Carlin.</p>

<p>I state to you now that the general nature of the Commission’s inquiry is to
ascertain, evaluate, and report upon the facts relating to the assassination
of President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.
In particular as to you, Mrs. Carlin, the nature of the inquiry today is to
determine what facts you know about the death of Oswald and any other
pertinent facts you may know about the general inquiry and in greater
particularity, about your conversation by telephone and otherwise with Jack
Ruby on the night of the 23d of November, on the 24th of November, and the
sending of money by Western Union to you.</p>

<p>Now Mrs. Carlin, I know that you are expecting a baby, and that as a matter
of fact the time for the baby to be born is actually past. For that reason, I
want to state to you that if in the course of this deposition, which I do not
think will last very long anyhow, but if in the course of you feel the slightest
discomfort and wish to stop it or recess it, please don’t hesitate to say so, and
we will accommodate you completely. You understand that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just any time you feel you want to stop the deposition, just
let us know right away.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now you have appeared here, I think, as a result of a letter
addressed to you by Mr. J. Lee Rankin, General Counsel of the President’s
Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have received that letter, I think?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. [Produces letter.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you receive that letter more than 3 days ago?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now you need not stand, but would you raise your right hand
and I will swear you in. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are
about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Jackson, it may be that you have not seen that, and if
you wish to have a moment to look it <span class="locked">over——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let the record show Mr. Jackson indicates he doesn’t wish to
stop now.</p>

<p>What is your name, please, ma’am?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Karen Lynn Carlin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old are you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Twenty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you live, Mrs. Carlin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. 1312 Fairmont.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At present I take it you are unoccupied?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know a man by the name of Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you state for the record now, ma’am, how you came
to know him and how long you have known him, and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. It was through my husband that I came to know him. I was
working at the Theatre Lounge as a stripper and I didn’t like the job there
nor the employers, so my husband had heard about the Carousel Club through
girls that worked there at the Theatre Lounge, so I went over and talked to
Mr. Ruby and in turn I went over and received a job after talking to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember about when that was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. September?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Answer on your own.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it in 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me put it this way. Perhaps we can arrive at it this way.
How long before the death of the President did you start to work for Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I don’t know. I would say about 2 months. I hadn’t been there
very long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What sort of employment did you obtain with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Stripper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your compensation for the job? I mean, was it
salary?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. It was salary. Seven days a week. It was $120 a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. A hundred and twenty dollars a week and a 7-day week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On what day of the week were you paid?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. On Saturdays.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Saturday nights?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who paid you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know a man by the name of Ralph Paul?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your understanding of his relation to Jack Ruby or
to the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Well, as I understood it, I met him in the office of Jack Ruby,
and he was supposed to be a friend from Chicago that had known him, and
he just introduced me as Ralph. And the only thing I knew was that he was
a friend of Jack Ruby’s. I didn’t know he had any connection with the club
at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see this gentleman Ralph Paul only once?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes. Before the killing of the President, I only saw him once.
But after that, I saw him all the time. He came in all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean he was actually operating the club after?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes, afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you find out then that he was the owner and operator of
a drive-in restaurant called the Bull Pen at Arlington?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know that now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But in any case, prior to the time when Oswald was shot, you
had met Paul only once, and you don’t know what his relationship was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About this young man called Andrew Armstrong, do you recall
him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. The colored man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was his function there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Well, he was supposed to be the janitor to clean up and do
little errands and to run the bar. Afterwards, it turned out that he also had
a part in running the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean after?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. After the President was killed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You stayed on at the club until what date?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. It was December. I quit—no, I couldn’t say it was in December.
It was right before the first. It was a week before the first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The first of the year?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. January; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Larry Crafard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Not by name; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember Larry?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember a man that stayed there and slept on the
premises?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No; I don’t know of anyone that did. Andrew was the only
one I knew that ever spent the night there, and that was just because he would
say so the next evening. He said, “I am tired.” Said, “I had to stay here
all night.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I might add that this man Larry’s full name was Curtis Laverne
Crafard.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes. That was a little young boy, the one that worked the lights.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He stayed on the premises?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes. But he stayed next door most of the time. I know he
was sleeping there for a while, but Jack put a stop to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean Jack wouldn’t let him sleep in the club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Jack didn’t like him sleeping there, because there was too many
things gone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then he made him go next door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. He went next door. I don’t know who was next door or what
it was next door, but he went next door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But what you heard was that this man had, Crafard, Curtis
Laverne Crafard had been staying on the premises, but that Jack had put a
stop to it and made him move to some place next door, but you don’t know
which next door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who did you hear this from?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. It was from Larry. He was taking care of the dogs or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He told you he had to move out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Out of the premises altogether?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No. He just said, “I am going to have to move. I can’t stay
here. I don’t know where I am going to get the money, but I am going to have
to move.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That must have happened just before the assassination of the
President?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes. After that I didn’t see Larry no more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So to your knowledge he never did actually move, but just
said he was going to have to move, and he informed you that Jack had told
him he would have to move?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. When you say move, you mean move out at night and not sleep
there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is what I meant, to move next door, I think is what you
meant?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now coming to the event of November 22, where were you?
Do you recall when you heard about the shooting of the President?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. At home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you hear it, on TV?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Television. No; I take that back. The first I heard was when
I got the telephone call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who did you receive a telephone call from?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Andrew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Armstrong?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he tell you, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. He just said that the President had been shot and we weren’t
going to open, that we would open the next night, and I hung up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, it would be closed on Friday, but open on
Saturday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Anytime you want to interject any kind of comment, let me
know and I will stop. You did not speak to Ruby at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No. Andrew was calling from the club, he said, and just
wanted to let all the girls know that they needn’t come to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you stay then in Fort Worth that night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you indicated that Andrew did not tell you that the club
would not be open Saturday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Saturday.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. He said that it would probably be open Saturday. He said to
call to make sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He asked you to call to make sure?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you call?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Instead, you came in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes. I tried to call. There wasn’t anybody there in the evening,
so I went ahead and got ready and went to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you come?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you come alone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No; I didn’t. I didn’t come by bus. I came with Tammi
True, another stripper. She had to come over and collect her salary. She
had been fired by Ruby, and she was coming over to get her salary, so she
brought my husband, and I went over to Dallas with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She had an automobile?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She was living in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When had she been fired, do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes. She had been fired Thursday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know why she was fired?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes. There was a question about salary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you mean she thought she should get more?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you all park the automobile then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. In the car lot next door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nichols’ car lot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I don’t know the name of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, what happened then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Then we got to the club and the doors were locked, and there
was no sign of anybody being in there, so we <span class="locked">thought——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what time was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. It was about 8:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there a sign up saying that the club would be closed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes. They were closed, but it didn’t say when or how long or
when it would open or anything on it. We went upstairs to the Carousel Club—I
mean the Colony Club next door and waited a few minutes hoping they would
open up, thinking possibly it would be late, and we would wait up there 30 or
40 minutes. And my husband checked several times to see if they were open,
and I said, “Tammy, if you are broke,”—she knew how to get ahold of him,
because she was broke. She didn’t have any salary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t have any money?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. None whatsoever?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. We had a little change. I think 40 or 50 cents, change. And
Tammy said she didn’t <span class="locked">want——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Between you and your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes. And I asked Tammy how to get ahold of Jack and she
gave me his home phone, and that is when I tried to call Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you reach him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes; I reached him at home. He answered the telephone.
And I asked Jack if we were going to be open, and he got very angry and was
very short with me. He said, “Don’t you have any respect for the President?
Don’t you know the President is dead?” And I said, “Jack, I am sorry. Andrew
said that perhaps we would be open, and I don’t have any money, and you
know I am supposed to get paid.” And I wanted some money on my pay to
get back home. And he said, “I don’t know when I will open. I don’t know
if I will ever open back up.” And he was very hateful. And he said something
he had to come down to the club in about an hour and for me to wait and he
would see me then. And I hung up and told my husband what had happened,
and we waited and waited and he didn’t show up. That is when my husband
and I went down to the garage and Tammi had to go see some friend there at
the Theatre Lounge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This first call that you made was not made from the garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No. It was made from the Colony Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So then you went over to the garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the purpose of going there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Because we wouldn’t have any more money and we didn’t want
to sit up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So then did you call Mr. Ruby again?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you or your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. My husband.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you present when your husband called?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear what your husband, at least, said on his end of
the line?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes; but I didn’t pay much attention. I was sitting in the chair
talking to the man that was in there, the man that worked at the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you are not able to tell us really what happened on your
husband’s end of the line?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened after that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Well, my husband then handed the phone to me and called me
back to the phone so I got on the telephone and Jack said, “Tell the man at the
garage, put him on the phone,” and he said, “I will let you have $5 to get back
home.” And that was all that was said, and he gave me $5, and I signed a receipt,
and that was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you talk to Jack about the rest of your salary?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much in fact was due at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I don’t remember. I had drew some on my salary. I wouldn’t
say for sure, but I had drew some that week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were asking him not merely for $5, but all that was due you,
I take it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No; I was just asking him for an advance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, I see.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Because he had been nice to me and let me have an advance before,
so I just wanted an advance until he got the club back open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was your salary due at the end of the week or the beginning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. At the end of the week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Wasn’t your salary due that Saturday night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I think it was; yes. I think I got paid on Saturday. It was
either Saturday or Monday, I don’t remember, because I got my salary on
Monday twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Karen, could you have gotten paid on Sunday night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. It could have been Sunday. It was either Saturday or Sunday.
I got paid twice on Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. On this particular night of November 23, on the telephone when
you talked to Jack and he said I will let you have $5 through the garageman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
and, you signed the receipt, did you ask him for any given amount of money or
just for some money?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Just enough money to get back home on, and I happened to
mention I would need money for rent tomorrow, and he said to call him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Call him tomorrow?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes. He didn’t say what time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, on the Saturday night you did mention to him
the question of getting not merely the $5, enough to get back, but really a part
of your salary, which would become due whenever pay day was, whether it was
Saturday night or Sunday or Monday night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do I understand you that his remark was, “Well, I will let you
have $5 now and then call tomorrow?”</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say that he would send you money the next day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No; he did—just said call him tomorrow and he would talk
about that tomorrow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, the call that he wanted you to make on Sunday
was with reference to your request for your pay?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I gather that he was not disposed to talk about it then, but invited
you to call him the next day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And mentioned no time at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, then, did you call him the next day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, where did you call him from?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. From our home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was that now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I don’t remember the address. Meadowbrook Drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Mr. Weldon Thompson—did you all have a phone listed in
your own name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Bruce Carlin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it listed in your husband’s name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That phone you used?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you called Jack?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. At home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it a long distance call between Fort Worth and Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Charged to your phone, I take it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember what time you called him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. It was 10. I think it was around 10 or 10:05 or 10:15, something
like that. It was between that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you be able to say with any degree of accuracy that it
could not have been earlier than 10?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. It could have been. I am not going to say for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, the fact of the matter is, the phone records show—I don’t
have them before me, but the phone records show it was about that time. Could
you just tell us the gist of the conversation with Jack on that occasion.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Well, Jack answered the telephone. And I told him who it was,
and he said, “Yes, well,” and I said, “I have called, Jack, to try to get some
money, because the rent is due and I need some money for groceries, and you
told me to call.”</p>

<p>And he said, “How much will you need?” And I said—I’ll ask my husband,
and then I said about “$25.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your husband was in the room with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes. He was in the part of the front part of the house. And
he said, “Well, I have to go downtown anyway, so I will send it to you by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
Western Union.” And he asked me what name to send it in, and I told him,
“Karen Bennett.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it arranged to be sent to your home or what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No; to Western Union downtown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you about what time to expect it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No. I asked him what time, about how long, and he didn’t
say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean he didn’t say anything, or he said he didn’t know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. He said, “Well,” he did say it would take a little while to get
dressed and something about the dog, I don’t remember what it was. And
he said, “I’ll go on down and send it to you.” And I said, “I sure would appreciate
it.” And that is about all there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now was your rent in fact due?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had your landlord been pressing you for the rent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Ruby seem to be annoyed that you were asking for money
on Sunday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No; he—not that Sunday, he didn’t seem to be annoyed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think that there was a difference in his attitude toward
the money that you asked for on Sunday as opposed to the money you asked
for the night before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes. He still seemed upset, you know, or hateful, short, but he
didn’t seem as much as he was Saturday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He definitely indicated to you that he would have to dress, is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes. He said, “It will take me about 20 or 30 minutes to
get dressed, and then I will go on down.” And something that he had to do
with the dogs’ freedom, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. About the dogs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes. He had some dogs. Kept them in the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now when did you first hear about Oswald’s shooting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Well, I heard that right after I talked to Jack. It wasn’t very
long after that on the television, and my husband was watching the television
and I was washing dishes, and my husband said, “Karen, isn’t that Jack?”
And I said, I thought he was joking. I told him to shut up and I started
laughing, and sure enough it came out that it was Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean you saw pictures of Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. After that on the news.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Rerun, you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are talking about that famous picture that shows Jack
coming through?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It shows really the back of him, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you able to recognize him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. They knew his name. They had already broadcast his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that when you saw, you recognized him? You mean you
recognized his name before you saw any picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes. My husband was the one that first saw him. I didn’t
see it. It was a rerun, I think, that I saw, because they already had his
name and that he had the Carousel Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This was prior to the time you went to Western Union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No; I had not gone down to Western Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This was prior?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do about the money at Western Union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. After I saw the thing on television, I said I bet Jack didn’t
send the money, so my husband dialed the number and he asked if they had
a money order for me, and they said, “Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean dialed the number to the Western Union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes. And he said, “Yes, they did.” Then my husband and
I got dressed and after we ate, we got dressed and went down and picked
it up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. <span class="locked">Well——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. About what time was this call made, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Could it have been in the afternoon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes. It probably was in the afternoon, because after I talked
to Jack, we ate and washed dishes, and I cleaned up the house, and it took me
a while to get dressed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then you all went down to Western Union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You signed the necessary papers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. We had to take a bus down, so that took quite a while, too. I
don’t remember what time it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was the money paid to the landlord, do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes; we paid the rent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That same day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I don’t remember if it was the same day or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, did you keep the money, or did you give it to your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I gave it to my husband. We didn’t have enough money to
get back on the bus, so we had to take some of it and go back on the bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t follow you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. We rode a bus downtown, and we had enough money to get
downtown, but not enough to get back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have to use part of the $25 to get back, but you gave
the difference to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had your landlord been pressing you for the money?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No. It wasn’t just the rent. It was groceries, too, because
my husband wasn’t working at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had not known Jack Ruby, I take it, prior to the time
you first went to work for him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No. I had seen Jack Ruby one other time before that, but I
didn’t know who he was.</p>

<p>My girl friend and I, a stripper, at the Theatre Lounge, was walking to the
bus stop at the Greyhound bus station to get something to eat during our
hour break, and we were walking, and this big Cadillac drove up and tooted
the horn and my girl friend smiled and it turned out to be Jack Ruby after I
met him. I knew who it was. But he left a card on the sidewalk in front
of us saying the Carousel Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long before you went to work for him, then, did that episode
take place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. This was about 2 weeks before, because I went home and told
my husband about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was driving a Cadillac?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes. There was three of them in the car, two men and one
woman. I never did see the man or woman, didn’t recognize them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was driving?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. It was Jack. It turned out to be Jack. I asked him if he
was the one that was driving the car and threw the card on the sidewalk, and
he said, “Yes, I was.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever find out who the other people were in the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No; I never did ask him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you find out subsequently what kind of car Jack drove?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This was definitely a Cadillac?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes. It could have been the other person’s car he was driving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There was one man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. There was two men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Two men besides Jack?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. One besides Jack. Looked like a redheaded woman. After I
saw Jack later—at that time I thought it was a stripper, but I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They were all riding in the front of the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The girl was in the middle, I take it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was about 2 weeks after that that you went to work
for him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you mention the name of the girl who was with you at that
time? I think you did.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. It could have been Jada.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I meant the girl that you were walking with?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. She was a stripper. I don’t remember her name. She had
a hose act. I don’t remember her name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Kathy Kay?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No. My husband could probably—it was Liza Sommers, because
he adored her little act.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Liza?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Sommers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember Wally Weston?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember when he left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No. I wasn’t there when he left. You are talking about the
Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No. I was never there when he performed there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, he left before you got there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes; I met him after he left there and went in the theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember a time when a man by the name of Rocco
came to the Carousel and took quite a number of pictures of Ruby and the girls
and the acts and so forth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. There was so many people taking pictures all the time, that
I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This was—this man was from a magazine or at least he was
attempting—this was quite some time prior to the assassination, but he came
there and—as an advertising stunt or something of the sort, and took quite
a number of pictures. Do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No; because I remember two or three different ones that came
before this ever happened, so I don’t know who you are talking about. But
they were all supposed to be from some kind of magazine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember a picture of you and Tammi True and Jack
together when Jack was sitting in his office in a chair and Tammi was on one
side and you were on the other in sort of a crouch?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember that picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About when was that taken, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. That was before the shooting of the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, yes; I know. But how much longer, do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I don’t know. I am not any good on times or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you tell us whether it was—how long after you went
to work for Jack was that picture taken? Now I am talking about the one
that I have just described with Ruby in the middle and Tammi on one side
and you on the other?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. There was never one taken with Tammi. The only one I had
taken was with—what is her name—the one that was pregnant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The large redheaded girl, the one that appeared in a magazine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I can’t place her name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Joy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes, Joy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. McDonald?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No; I can’t think of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Her stage name was Joy Dale?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the one I meant. I said Tammi True, but I was mistaken
myself. She had dark curly hair?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, as to that picture, can you relate the time of taking
that picture to the time when you first went to work there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No; I guess it was a month after that, I know. At least, but
I don’t know how much longer after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know whether it was summertime <span class="locked">or——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No; it was winter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hilbert</span>. It was winter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes; it was getting cold.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you relate it—I think I have asked you this before, but
perhaps your memory is fresher now. Can you relate it to the time of the death
of the President?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I would say 2 or 3 weeks before the death of the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember a rather large heavy fat man, very heavily
built, who used to come to the Carousel almost every weekend and used to sit
close by the stage and sort of carry on a banter with the theatre?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know who he is?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No; I don’t know who he is. But I remember him. He weighed
about 300 pounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Used to beat on the stage and holler and scream. I don’t remember—I
don’t know his name. I never did meet him, but I remember him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know George Senator?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Not by name. I probably would know his face, but I don’t
know his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know what his relationship was to Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then do you know—and I don’t mean from your own knowledge
at all, but from what you might have heard, what Jack’s relationship
in general with people of the opposite sex was? What his relationship with
girls was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No; I would rather not answer it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is all right. Mind you, I want it clear I was not asking
in relation to anything with respect to you yourself, but as to what you have
heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Did he ever make any advances towards you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes; one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. In other words, he did do that with the girls occasionally—make
advances toward them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Proposition them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes; I knew of them going with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Dating them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. He did date them some?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Did you know or had you heard anything concerning the
possibility of any kind of homosexuality on the part of Jack?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Is that just a rumor running out there, or what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. That was from his mouth. He was always asking the question,
“Do you think I am a queer? Do you think I look like a queer? Or have you
ever known a queer to look like me?” Every time I saw him he would ask it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Do you mean he would bring up the subject himself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes; he would say, “Do you think I look like one or act like
one?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Did he say he was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No; he just asked me, “Do I look like one.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. But he never admitted to you of being one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Or ever made any statements that indicated that he was a
homosexual?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. What you have told us here is all that you know about his
abnormality, if any?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you throw any light upon his character with respect to
whether he had a good temper or easygoing temper or quick temper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. He was very quick tempered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have occasion to observe that yourself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you give us just one or two examples that would serve to
illustrate why you have the impression that he was quick tempered.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Well, the time that makes me think he was so quick tempered
there was two times.</p>

<p>One was with Tammi True. Tammi had—Joy Dale had been out of work
for about a week. She had played sick, and this was known all over the club,
so Tammi True was supposed to be taking their act. And Joy Dale’s act,
making it hard on all of us. So Tammi went to Jack, and I was sitting in the
office when she said, “Jack, I am going to be 5 minutes late for my show,” and
Jack said, “Okay.” So she went to the back to get dressed, and I went back
right after that, and he came back—the music started—he didn’t tell the band
like he was supposed to, so the music went ahead and started for Tammi to
go on, and that upset her. And Jack came back and said, “What the blank-blank
* * *”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Used some obscene words?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I take it you prefer not to use it yourself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it obscene?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes; and she said, “Well, I had already told you that I was
going to be late and you were supposed to let the band know, and you are blaming
me.” And Jack said something else like, “Hurry up and get your ass dressed.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And there again you used an obscene term which I take it you
don’t care to use yourself, in reference to her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes; and she then turned around and jumped on him and said,
“If you can let Joy Dale hold out a whole week and make all of us suffer, you can
damn sure wait on me.” And he said, “You are not going to con me. You may
con other people, but you are not going to con me.” And he stormed out of
the room. So the following show she was deliberately late, and he came back
and raised cane again, and he said something about he was going to fire her if
she didn’t straighten up, that she thought she could use him, and that is about
all that was said. They kept fussing back and forth and calling each other
names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I take it from that that his manifestation of temper was first
in the use of obscenity, and second in a loud tone of voice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes; screaming.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he manifest on that occasion or any occasion that he might
use physical force, or did he ever as a matter of fact?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No; I never saw him raise his hand to hit anybody or anything
like that, although with Tammi, he did say he would throw her down the stairs
if she didn’t straighten up. And she said, “I don’t have to leave. I have a contract.”
And he said, “That contract don’t mean a God damn thing.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. You don’t have to use those words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you said that that was one example. Do you have any
others?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. With Joy Dale.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you tell us about that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. It was about the same thing. She had came back to work
and was supposed to be pregnant and sick, and she was dying, so she came in,
she was late for her first show, and Jack didn’t say anything, and all of us girls
were mad and wouldn’t talk to her. So she did her first show, and she was
supposed to be hurting bad and she wanted to get out of the second show,
and just came back from the week after staying out, and she went to Jack,
and you could hear her plumb to the opposite office.</p>

<p>There was a wall, and you could hear her there fussing and cussing because
she wanted to take off the second show. And he told her she had been off a
week and he couldn’t afford to pay her salary when she wasn’t doing a job at
all. And he said, “If you don’t like your job, you know what you could do.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that an indication that there might have been some relationship
between them other than business?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes. Well, I know it wasn’t hearsay. I know that they were
going together, and Joy was using this over his head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. How do you know this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. She told me, and also Jack made indications that he was going
with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That she went to his apartment or he went to hers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Only what Joy would tell me, and Joy was a big liar. She was
known to lie about things that she had no reason to lie about. She would
lie about men making passes just to make the girls ask her questions and be
the center of attention, so I wouldn’t say she was telling the truth when she
said anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you ever met Jack’s sister, Eva Grant?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You know of her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never met her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. After the President’s killing, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you come to meet her then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. She was at the club and she was having an argument with
Ralph. I believe it was either Ralph or the other gray-haired guy. I don’t
know his name—about the club. That it was her club, she was going to run it,
and Ralph was saying he was left in charge of the club, and as long as he was
financing the club, she wasn’t going to run it. And there was an argument
between her and one of the girls about the fact that she wasn’t going to work
for Eva because she had tried to work for Eva and it wouldn’t work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you tell me something about the gray-haired man other
than the one you identified as Ralph Paul?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. This was a—I don’t know his name. He was in there quite a
bit after the President’s killing. He was in there almost every night. He was
supposed to be one of Jack’s closest friends or supposed to have lived with Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That wouldn’t have been Senator, would it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever hear that perhaps that man was one of his brothers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No. It wasn’t one of his brothers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember anything further about him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No; I don’t, because I never did talk to him but once, and that
was just about then. He was there a lot of times at the door. He took all the
cover charges after that. Either him or Ralph was taking cover charges.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he seem to be in authority?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No; he didn’t have authority. He thought he did, but he didn’t,
because Ralph would tell him to do what was done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you ever seen him at the Carousel prior to the time that
Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes. Just two or three times. He was sitting down at a table
next to the cashier, where the cash register was. He was sitting there with the
guy that Joy Dale was going with. I don’t remember his name, but it was a
young boy. Tommy something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the gray-haired man you saw sitting with a young man
called Tommy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was Joy Dale’s boy friend?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes. They were supposed to get married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you saw them, this gray-haired man and Tommy, several
times together?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. About two or three times, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long before the President’s death?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Oh, I don’t know. I never did pay that much attention to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were they always together, those two?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I wouldn’t say they were together. He just was sitting there.
I don’t know whether they left together or nothing, whether they were friends
or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But they were sitting at the same table?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You wouldn’t remember if the two or three times prior to the
President’s death that you saw them together were consecutive nights or not,
would you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No; I never did pay that much attention to either one of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you think those two or three times, whatever they were,
that you saw Tommy and the gray-haired man together, would have been
within a week prior to the President’s death?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I wouldn’t say, because I didn’t pay that much attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But in any case, the gray-haired man that you have been referring
to subsequently had really a job with the club? That is to <span class="locked">say——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No; not at that time, he wasn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean later. I said subsequently.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After Oswald was killed then this same gray-haired man had a
job collecting the cover charges at the front door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Whether he was paid for it or not, he was doing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he seemed to be, so far as you could tell, under the authority
of Paul?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Ralph?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Ralph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Ralph Paul?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Well, I don’t know anything about Ralph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old a man is Ralph? Are you feeling bad?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No. He is about 40 or 45, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Ralph Paul is?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes; between 40 and 45. He is old. He is old to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I think that is the age of the interrogator.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I am sorry, but he is old to me. Gray-haired and being so fat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. The closer you get to it, the younger it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you seen Ruby since Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Only in court.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You testified in court?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Two; I went to two different court hearings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you testify twice or once?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was the first one on the insanity hearing, I suppose?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I don’t know what the hearing was on. I think it was on the
bond hearing. He was trying to get out on bond.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you testify at his actual trial in the latter part of February
and the first part of March?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you tell us what was the general nature of your testimony
there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. The same thing that has been asked here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you been interviewed by Mr. Belli prior?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No; the only time I talked to Belli was on the bond hearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you haven’t talked to Jack Ruby since you talked to him on
the phone on Sunday the 24th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I can’t say the last time I talked to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know Billy DeMar?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was one of the Emcee’s there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, you have heard the rumors that he is supposed to
have said that he had seen Oswald in the club prior to the shooting of the
President?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see pictures of Oswald afterward?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see anybody who looked like that man in the
Carousel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Well, just like I told the FBI, I have seen someone that looked
like him. Whether it was him or whether I have seen him, he could favor anybody,
you know. I have seen the face, something that looked, someone that
looked like him, and I am not going to say it was in the club or where it was at,
but I have seen someone that looked like him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, you didn’t know Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If you get tired, let me know, and we will stop. Let me ask you
some concluding questions and we will take a little recess and I will gather my
thoughts and see if we have anything more. Have you been interviewed by
any member of the Commission’s staff prior to today?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mrs. Carlin, I have in my hand a document consisting of two
pages which purport to be a copy of a report of an interview of you by Special
FBI Agents Peggs and Zimmerman on November 26, 1963, which for the purpose
of identification I am marking as follows: Fort Worth, Texas, April 15, 1964,
Exhibit 5318, Deposition of Karen B. Carlin. Do you spell your name with a
“K” or “C”?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. K-a-r-e-n C-a-r-l-i-n.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your first name is spelled with a “K”, but your last name is
spelled with a “C”?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I am signing my name below that, for the purpose of identification.
On the second page thereof, in the lower right-hand corner I am placing
my initials. Mrs. Carlin, I will ask you if you have had an opportunity, with
your attorney, Mr. Jackson, to read this statement?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is this statement a fair statement of the interview that you had
with the FBI agents?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mir. Hubert. Do you see anything in it, and I will ask your attorney to assist
you, since he helped you to read it and went over it, do you see anything that
needs to be changed, adjusted, or modified?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes; the part where it says, “Just for rent.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are referring to a sentence in the third paragraph about the
middle of that paragraph which reads as follows, to wit: “She called Ruby
again on Sunday, November 24, 1963, at 10 or 10:30 a.m., as she needed money
to pay her rent.” Now that is the sentence that you are referring to, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What comment do you wish to make about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Well, I didn’t ask him for just money for the rent. It was for
groceries also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You actually mentioned to him that it was for groceries as well
as for rent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, do you have any other parts that you wish to change?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes; the last sentence in the third paragraph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now you are speaking of the sentence which reads as follows,
to wit: “Karen used her Texas driver’s license as identification.” What comments
do you wish to make about that, Mrs. Carlin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. It was a California driver’s license.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, are there any other parts of that statement which are
incorrect or need modification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. The fourth paragraph, first sentence which reads as follows:
“At the time she talked with Ruby, Sunday morning, she asked him if the club
was going to be open Sunday night. He became upset regarding this, then talked
harshly to her, indicating that he did not feel she was showing the proper respect
toward the deceased President.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What comment do you wish to make about that sentence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. It was not Sunday that he said anything about the President.
It was Saturday night that he talked real harshly regarding the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do I understand you to say then that when you spoke to him on
Sunday morning, that the subject of the President was not mentioned at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. That’s right. He just sounded preoccupied and upset.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. That was on Sunday that he sounded preoccupied?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes; he sounded distant. In other words, I called him back
twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You called him back twice on Sunday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes; I am talking about when he was talking to me. I would
say, “Jack, are you still there?” Or “Jack,” to get his attention back. He
seemed like he was busy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I gather from that that when you would speak to him on the
phone, you didn’t get a response, so it gave you the impression that he wasn’t
there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you would repeat your question?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are there any other parts of this statement that you would like
to make any comments about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do I understand that other than the corrections that have been
made, that this statement contains the truth, so far as you know it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there anything you think should be deleted from it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now Mrs. Carlin, is there anything else you would like to say
about any aspect that we have been talking about, or any fact that you might
know that you have not heretofore stated to anyone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Nothing that I can think of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Excuse me just a minute.</p>

<p>(Mr. Jackson and witness whisper to each other.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. May I see you a minute, Mr. Jackson?</p>

<p>(Mr. Jackson and Mr. Hubert confer off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. One more question, Mrs. Carlin. Did anyone ask you or suggest
to you, directly or indirectly, that you make this call on Sunday morning
to Mr. Ruby, or is it that you made this call for the purpose which you have
already stated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. The purpose of the call was for which I have already stated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No one suggested that you make it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Jack told me to call him the following day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But other than Jack no one else did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, Ma’am, I think that is all.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. There is one thing I would like to clear up, what I said a while
ago. A while ago you asked me did Jack Ruby make a pass. It was not a
pass, it was just asking me. It was not kissing or anything like that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t think I asked you that question. I think Mr. Jackson
did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. In other words, he just asked you for a date, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. And you refused him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. And that is the only time he ever made any advances toward
you whatsoever?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now we have the transportation to take Mrs. Carlin back if she
would like to go right away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Do you want to go right now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. I will wait until Bruce gets through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If you want, you can sit right where you are.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carlin</span>. Okay.</p>

<h2 id="LANE">TESTIMONY OF DOYLE E. LANE</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of Doyle E. Lane was taken at 12:05 p.m., on March 31, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President’s
Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Lane, my name is Leon Hubert, I am a member of the advisory
staff of the General Counsel on the President’s Commission. Under the
provisions of Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, the Joint Resolution
of Congress No. 137, and the rules of procedure adopted by the Commission
in conformance with the Executive order and the resolution, I am authorized
to take a sworn deposition from you, Mr. Lane. I state to you now that the
general nature of the Commission’s inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate, and report
upon the facts relating to the assassination of President Kennedy and the
subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald. In particular, as to you, Mr.
Lane, the nature of the inquiry today is to determine what facts you know
about the death of Oswald and any other pertinent facts you may know about
the general inquiry. Particularly the sending of the Western Union telegram.
Now, Mr. Lane, you have appeared here today by virtue of a letter sent to you,
I believe, by Mr. J. Lee Rankin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That letter was received by you prior to 3 days from today, was it
not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. It was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, will you stand, sir, and raise your right hand
and be sworn. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. State your full name, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Doyle E. Lane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Thirty-five.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you live, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Dallas, Tex. 6549 Lake Circle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Clerk, Western Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been so occupied?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Eleven years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What particular function do you have, as clerk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Well, I’m a senior delivery clerk is what I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What particular office do you work for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Work for the office at 2034 Main, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that the main office of the Western Union here?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you on duty on the morning of November 24, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see a man by the name of Jack Ruby that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know him prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I had known him through patronage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, when he came into the Western Union office
that day you recognized him as Jack Ruby, a man with whom you had done
Western Union telegraph business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. When he handed me the money order. I did not see him come in. I
do not know when he came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you just state in your own words what transpired between
you and Jack Ruby on the morning of November 24, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Well, he came to the counter and handed me the money order
to be sent. I rated the money order and put the necessary transmission marks
on it. Wrote out a receipt for the money he handed me and I believe it was
$30, to pay for the money order. I handed him back his receipt and his change.
He turned around and walked out the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The first time you saw him, therefore, is when he came up to
the counter with a completed—partially completed form for the transmission
of money by Western Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. That is the first I had seen him that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Therefore, you don’t know how long he was in the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I have no idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Prior to the time he came up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I have no idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there a public telephone available to anyone who is in the
lobby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes, there is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him use the telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On that morning, was there any kind of radio, or TV in the
Western Union office, whereby a person in that office could have heard the
news concerning the pending transfer of Oswald from the city hall to the
county jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Not in the office; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No one had a small radio or transistor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. The messenger boy had a transistor, but he was out delivering, and
he did not get back until 10 or 15 minutes after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There was no radio or television audible or visible to anyone
in the Western Union office at the time Jack Ruby was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No, there was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Lane, I am marking two documents, which have already
been identified by Mr. W. W. Semingsen, president—vice president of the Western
Union Telegram Co., when his deposition was taken by Mr. Wesley J. Liebeler,
a member of the staff of the President’s Commission. On the first document I
have marked “Dallas, Texas, March 31, 1964. Exhibit 5118, Deposition of
Doyle Lane.” I have placed my name under this language. It purports to be
a photostatic copy of the original which Mr. Semingsen produced at his deposition.
In order that the record may show that you and I are both talking about
the same document, I ask you to put your name below mine on this document.
Now, I am marking the other document as follows: “Dallas, Texas, March 31,
1964. Exhibit 5119, Deposition of Doyle Lane,” and signing my name on that,
and ask you to put your name on it so that the record may show that we
are talking about the same document. Now, I ask you to look at Exhibit
5118, and state for the record what that document is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. This is a money order application filed to send money. $25.
Karen Bennett, Fort Worth, Tex., from Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I notice that there are several handwritings on that, and, of
course, you will identify your own in a moment. Can you state for the record<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
what handwriting was on that, or what was on that document at the time it
was handed to you by Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. “25.00 Karen Bennett. Will call. Fort Worth. Jack Ruby.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That all seems to be printed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. That is printed; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see Ruby write it out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But he did hand it to you in that form?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. He did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he give you money at the same time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes, sir; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember how much?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. $30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall whether he took it out of his wallet, or a roll of
money, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. He took it from several bills in his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What denominations were the bills that he handed to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. A $20 and a $10 bill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, would you state what you did with reference to this
transaction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. You mean my markings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your markings and your actions, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Well, when he handed me this I rated the money order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. The charges.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Rated, [spelling] R-a-t-e-d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What does “rated” mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. It is actual money order charges that we charge to transmit this
money to its destination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that rating process indicated by you on that Exhibit 5118?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. In that top right-hand corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whose handwriting is that in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. That is my handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What figures are you talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. “$25.55, the $1.20, and 12 cents tax. $26.87.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you did give him change?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I notice that in the printed message there are the words, “Fort
Worth,” scratched out, and something, who wrote that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I wrote that. It was spelled wrong to begin with, and I wrote
that for this purpose. We have to have a full destination in the body of a
money order. He just used Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, that you scratched out the “F.” W-o-r-t-h, and then wrote in
your own handwriting Fort Worth, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you identify your own handwriting, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I notice in the bottom right-hand corner of Exhibit 5118, the
words and figures as follows: “1312½ Commerce.” Whose handwriting is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. It is mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you get the information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. From Mr. Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You asked him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I said, “Your address?” And he gave me his address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I notice that there apparently is a time stamp on the top of
this document that says, “1963, November 24, a.m. 11:17.” Would you explain
what that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. That is the time that money order was accepted for transmission
at the counter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, explain when and how that stamp is placed—placed upon
that document?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. This stamp was placed here when I handed Mr. Ruby back his
receipt for his money and his change, because in our language that is the—accepting
a money order for transmission at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, that was not stamped when Mr. Ruby first came
to begin the transaction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No; it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was required that you do what you said you have done concerning
the document, to make the correction about “Fort Worth,” to do the
rating?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And did you write out the address at the bottom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And to make the change and give it to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, the 11:17, therefore, represents the moment
when the transaction was over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. When it is completed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And actually, it could have begun a few moments or minutes
before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. A minute or so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I wish you to explain for the record what kind of a timeclock
this is. And what steps are taken by the Western Union Co. locally and
nationally to assure the accuracy of that timeclock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. This timeclock is set up on a national level. Hooked up with the
U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C. And at 11 a.m., each day, all
clocks stop and all time is synchronized. The timeclock we have on the counter
rotates on a minute basis. It could be 1 minute, you know, either way. I think
<span class="locked">back——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, the particular timeclock that was used to stamp this
machine, is that the master clock—I mean to stamp this document, is this the
master clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No; it is not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What clock is synchronized to Naval Observatory Time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. It is the clock in the P&amp;R office, there for the purpose of having
somebody to check it and make sure it is accurate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it the custom of the company to have all of the master clocks
throughout the Nation synchronized each day at 11 o’clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. It is. It very definitely is. Our business is built on the time basis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, how is the particular timeclock which was used to stamp
the time on Exhibit 5118 synchronized to the master clock in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. When the master clock is set by the Naval Observatory Time,
at the same time our master clock here synchronizes all our timeclocks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that done automatically?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. It is done automatically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you willing to state, therefore, that from your knowledge
of how time and timeclocks throughout the Western Union system are set, that
at 11 o’clock on November 24th, the master clock in Dallas and the particular
timeclock used to stamp Exhibit 5118, were all synchronized on Naval Observatory
Time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes; they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I show you a document which, for the purpose of identification,
I have marked, “Dallas, Texas, Exhibit 5119,” already identified by you,
and your name appears on it, and ask you to tell me what that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. This is a copy of the original receipt that I wrote for Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. That is my handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened to the original itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. The original is given to the customer. It was given to Mr. Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember giving it to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes; very definitely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that document given to him when the change was given to
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. When the change was given back, his receipt was given back at
the same time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I notice that document also bears a time at the top of it. What
time does it show?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. 11:17.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you say it was stamped or would you say it was
stamped at the same time as Exhibit 5118?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In the normal course of business, which one would be stamped
first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. There would be no first. We stamp them at the same time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, it takes two different actions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Not fully.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No? Do you <span class="locked">mean——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. We have carbons. See, like on this receipt. That is a carbon
receipt. Well, you would stamp it one—or both could be stamped at the same
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, both have to actually be put in the machine, don’t they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I notice the times on those documents are in terms of minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is nothing to indicate the fractions of minutes involved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you be willing to say that the time that these transactions
took place could not have been earlier than 11:17 a.m., of November 24, nor later
than 11:18?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes; I would be willing to state that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, you can’t tell whether it would be 11:17 and a half or
something of that sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You do know that the clock mechanism had turned already to
11:17, but it had not yet turned to 11:18?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After you had handed Mr. Ruby his change and the original receipt,
of which 5119 is a copy, what did he do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. He turned immediately from the counter, went through the door
and went out and turned to the left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much distance is there between the counter and the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Oh, approximately 8 or 10 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, he went out the door that opened on Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he turned to his left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. To the left as you are facing the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In what direction would he then—towards what street would
he then be going?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Toward Harwood Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he stay any appreciable length of time in the office after you
had handed him the change and the receipt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No, he did not spend anytime—he went straight to the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He simply accepted the change and the receipt. Do you know
what he did with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I have no idea. I mean, he had them in his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He didn’t put them in his pocket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Not immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t see him put them in his pocket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No, I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you observe him after he left the office and turned to his
left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No, after he turned he would be out of sight—the shades were drawn
on that side, and I just saw him turn, and that was the last I saw of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he seem to be walking fast, slow, medium?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Just ordinary gait.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I notice on Exhibit 5118, another time, which seems to be
1963, November 24, p.m., 12:26. What does that mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. That is the time that the money order was put into the wire in
the upstairs <span class="locked">office——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, explain what you do after the application is accepted, the
money received, the change given back, the receipt given to the customer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I put it in a tube, suction tube that takes it directly upstairs to
be transmitted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you endorse anything on the application at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I endorse nothing. I have done all that before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see. “MOD,”——</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. “MOD,” is a transmission mark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes, it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is the significance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Money Order Department, Fort Worth from Money Order Department,
Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is done before it is stamped by the clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Before it is stamped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, once you put it in the tube, that is the end of it, as far as
you are concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know from your experience in your 10 or 12 years employment
with Western Union what happens when it gets upstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes, sir; it is removed from the tube, put on a sending position, and
sent. This day it was different because of the press. Press releases coming
in immediately, and many of them, so, it was delayed quite a while. Ordinarily,
it is about 20 minutes from here to Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, that stamp on 5118, is the Dallas time <span class="locked">of——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Time it was actually transmitted here in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does that work on the same clock system that you were speaking
of before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. A different machine, but synchronized, by the same master clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you mentioned something about a lot of press releases
coming in which delayed the message a little bit. Those press releases were
being handled upstairs, were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Most of them were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were any being handled downstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Well, reporters, running in there with scribbled notes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I am trying to get at, do you recall whether any reporters
came in with any kind of notes, or saying anything during the time that Jack
Ruby was there, which would have indicated to Ruby that the transfer of Oswald
was imminent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Oh, no. There was, as I recall—like I say, I don’t always notice
who comes in that office, because it is a stopping place for everyone, but as I
remember, my previous customer, before Jack Ruby, turned around and left
after the transaction. Ruby came up and was right there. He just handed me
the money order, apparently he had come in while I was waiting on the other
customer, because I believe there were only the two in the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After the first customer left, there was only you and Ruby at the
counter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t remember anybody coming in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Well, there was nobody between that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, do you remember anybody coming in while Ruby was there
indicating in any way whatsoever that the transfer of Oswald was going to
happen very shortly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Oh, no, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you aware at any time between 10:30 and 11:20 that an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
armored car had driven up and been placed in the Commerce Street entrance
of the jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No, I was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it possible for an individual who has a telephone, to send
money by use of a telephone instead of filing an application personally and paying
over the money in cash?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Not an individual. Not just the ordinary telephone subscriber is
not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I gather from your answer that in certain instances it is
possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. It is possible by prearrangement only.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you explain just what that would mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Ordinarily a prearrangement is a money deposit—deposit with
Western Union a certain sum of money and they are usually companies. In
fact, most of ours are companies that make these deposits in order that they
can phone that money order to be sent, we have money on deposit, we send it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is a prepaid money order?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. A prepaid arrangement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All that happens over the telephone is the request that money
already made on deposit be sent to a certain address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it possible to do it that way when no money is placed on
deposit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Only on a prearranged basis. Sometimes we won’t require deposits
if they are legitimate companies and a good credit rating with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know if Jack Ruby had any such arrangement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it normal for any individual to have it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No; it is very seldom. In fact, we don’t even have any in Dallas,
individuals.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Only companies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Only companies.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you any kind of security device to be sure that the person
calling is really authorized to be sending the money either on deposit or to be
charged?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Every money order called in is confirmed by telephone with
certain individuals within the firm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is by prearrangement also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. That is by prearrangement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what system is used by the Western Union Co.,
from your experience with the company during your tenure of employment
with them in connection with the payment of money to the addressee? What is
the normal system? What usually happens?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Well, that depends on whether he comes into the office or not.
In this instance the girl had identification as required. They have—the paying
clerk has to be satisfied within his or her own mind that the individual
they are talking to is the correct person, and like I say, identification is required.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, how does the Western Union office at the receiving end
get the information about paying money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. It is transmitted over the wires to the receiving end, stating the
amounts to be paid, the person to be paid to, the person’s address if they sent
it, and the person it is from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when that is received, is a check written out payable to
that person, or how is it handled?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. If it is to be delivered a Western Union check is written. If
it is to be picked up a cash receipt copy is made out and attached to the money,
and when the person comes in and gives them the identification required, asks
them the required questions, such as, “How much are you expecting? Who
is it from? Where is it from?” They have to answer those questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And is any identification of the individual required?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes; it is very definitely personal identification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what system is used by way of timing the various transactions
on the receiving end?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. On the receiving end, whenever the telegram is received in the
receiving office, it is time stamped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is time stamped by use of the same kind of machine that
you have identified before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. That we used before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Synchronized to the national time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. That is correct, and also timed at the time of payment. Time
you actually give the addressee the money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Stamped with the same clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By the way, all of this time that we have been speaking of
is central standard time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Central standard time; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you anything else, Mr. Lane, that we have not covered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No; I can’t think of anything that we haven’t covered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you been interviewed by any member of the Commission’s
staff other than myself prior to the taking of this deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, there was an interview between you and me, was there
not, just before the beginning of this deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Well, that is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have we covered in this deposition everything that we talked
about in the course of the interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes; we have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you—has there been anything of a material nature at all
covered in the interview which has not been covered in this deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Not a thing that I can think of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="PITTS">TESTIMONY OF ELNORA PITTS</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of Elnora Pitts was taken at 2:40 p.m., on March 31, 1964, in
the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President’s
Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Elnora Pitts.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pitts, my name is Leon Hubert.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am a member of the advisory staff of the General Counsel for
the President’s Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Under the provisions of Executive Order 11130, dated November
29, issued by President <span class="locked">Johnson——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And by a Joint Resolution of Congress No. 137, and the rules of
procedure adopted by the President’s Commission in conformance with the
Executive order and the joint resolution, I have been authorized to take the
sworn deposition from you today.</p>

<p>I say to you that the general nature of the Commission’s inquiry is to ascertain,
evaluate, and report upon the facts relating to the assassination of President
Kennedy and to the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald. And
in particular, as to you, Mrs. Pitts, the nature of the inquiry today is to determine
what facts that you know about the death of Oswald and any other pertinent
facts you may know about the general inquiry, particularly those facts concerning
Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I think you are appearing here as a result of a letter sent
to you by J. Lee Rankin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. General Counsel of the Commission. You have received that
letter, haven’t you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That letter was received more than 3 days from today?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir; it was—it must have been longer than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Sometime last week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. But, the man there, Mr. <span class="locked">Sorrels——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Sorrels?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. They called me and talked with me and called me again and told
me to come today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, the letter was received more than 3 days ago?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Because 3 days ago would be last Saturday, and it was received
before that, wasn’t it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you mind rising and taking the oath? Raise you right
hand, please.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. For the record, will you state your name.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. My name is Elnora Pitts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand that you are a widow?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your husband’s name was what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. McKinley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he has been dead how long?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Well, it has been a long time. Just exactly the date, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have not remarried?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your maiden name, before you married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Elnora Magee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Magee. How old are you, Mrs. Pitts?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Well, I was born 1903. That makes me about 60, don’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. I live at 1316 East Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir; Oak Cliff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oak Cliff?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What do you do for a living, Mrs. Pitts?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. I work in apartment houses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In apartment houses?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What kind of work do you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. That is cleaning. Cleaning, you see, from one apartment to another
but I <span class="locked">don’t——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You work in several apartment houses?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. I go—I don’t work everyday. When they call me I go; yes; and
then I have some regulars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, some apartments that you clean everyday, or
every week, or certain times?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Certain time every week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Mr. Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir. I know him, <span class="locked">but——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you known him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Well, now, that, I would have to get the real information on Mr.
David, Glen David, that was the manager of the apartments there. He was
with me down here on Ewing, Mr. David was, and then they transferred me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
on over to another apartment on Ewing where this Jack Ruby lived, so, just
to tell the truth how long that I worked for Mr. Ruby somewhere—so—along
8 or 9 or maybe 10 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How often did you go to his apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. I went one part of a day. On—I first started going to him on
Tuesday, and then he said that was because he hadn’t cleaned it in a long time,
and it was in a bad shape, so he paid me 7½ to clean it the first time, and so,
next time he paid me $4 and give me busfare and then he said to me, said,
“Well, it is getting pretty dirty,” said, “I’m going to give you a little raise now
today,” and I said, “All right.” So, the next time he give me 5½. From then
on he pay me 5½.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is for how much time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Until then I was going on Tuesday. Then he changed it then
until Saturday and from Saturday to Sunday. He says he had company and
wanted it fresh and clean on Sunday, and asked me if I would come on Sunday
morning and I told him, “Yes,” so that is why I called him that Sunday morning,
because that was my time to go, because I had something to do at home before
I went, so then I didn’t go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, as of November 24, 1963, it was your custom to go there
on a Sunday morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir; I guess that was the time when he done his killing,
was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, November 24 is the day that Oswald was shot.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Uh-huh. Well, then I called him on the next <span class="locked">Sunday——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me get <span class="locked">this——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you been going to him regularly on Sundays before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You always called?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. I called—called him, and always called the manager because I
went once and I didn’t call so they had to do something in there, and he had
a dog, and I was scared of this dog, so, the manager, she was there, and she
said, “Well, I will lock the dog in the bathroom,” and I said, “No; I don’t work
that way. I will just go back home.”</p>

<p>So, the next time I didn’t call and she was gone and he was gone, too, and
I—from then on I always called.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you called about what time in the morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Well, just different times, but that morning I don’t know what
time it was that I called. I know that it was 8:30, or might have been later
than that. I really don’t know for—I didn’t look at the clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That morning—what morning do you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. I think it was Sunday morning, you know, when you was saying
<span class="locked">about——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you do remember that Oswald was <span class="locked">shot——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was on Sunday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you do know that Mr. Ruby was accused of shooting Mr.
Oswald and was tried, as a matter of fact?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that is the man we are talking about, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that is the Sunday we are talking about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You called in there, as was your <span class="locked">custom——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To do the regular <span class="locked">weekly——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Cleaning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Work, and you say you don’t know what time it was?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No, I don’t, but it was—it was after 8. I know way after 8, and
when I called him he said to me, “What do you want?” And I <span class="locked">said——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you recognize his voice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Well, I’ll tell you how he talked to me, then I said, “What do
I want?” I says, “This is Elnora.” He says, “Yes, well, what—you need some
money?” And I says, “No; I was coming to clean today.”</p>

<p>“Coming to clean?” Like you know, like he <span class="locked">just——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, when you told him that you were coming to
clean he seemed to express some surprise, is that it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir; like he didn’t know that I was going to come and clean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he recognize you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. I don’t know if he did or not. And I says to him again, I says,
“This is Elnora.” And he says, “Well, what do you want?” And I said, “Well,
I was coming to clean today.”</p>

<p>“You coming now?” And I says, “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He asked you then, “Are you coming now?”</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir; and then I says, “No.” And he says, “Well, what you got
to do?” And I says, “I have got to go to the store for the children.” I always
goes to the store for the children before I come to work whenever I come. He
says, “Well,”—I says, “You seem so funny to me.” And I says, “Do you want
me to come today?” And he says, “Well, yes; you can come, but you call me.”
And I says, “That’s what I’m doing now, calling you so I won’t have to call you
again.” And he says, “And you coming to clean today?” And I said, “Yes.”
Well, he sounded so strange to me but I still wouldn’t say nothing to him. I
just stopped another few minutes, and I said, “Who am I talking to? Is this Mr.
Jack Ruby?” And he said, “Yes. Why?” And I said, “Oh, nothing.” But he
just sounded terrible strange to me, so, I said, “Well, I’ll call you.” And he says,
“But, I don’t see why I called you.” And he said, “Yes, so I can tell you where
the key will be and the money.” And I said, “Okay.” So, I hung up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you arrange a time to go then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. He told me to call him before I come.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you what time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. I told him that I would be there before 2 and he says for me to call
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he suggest 2 o’clock?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he say when you suggested 2?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. He said, “Why so late?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what did you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. I told him, said, “Well, I have got to go to the store, and I have
got some things to do.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell him you had some cleaning to do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir; I had some cleaning to do, straightening up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he agree that 2 o’clock would be all right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No; he didn’t seem to think that 2 o’clock was all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But he asked you to call him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir; he asked me to call him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ask you to call him at 2 or what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No; he says, “You call me before 2,” that is what he says. He
says, “Be sure you call me.” To call before 2, “Before you come.” He says,
“You call me before 2, before you start,” and I says, “Well, what I have to call
you again for?” And he says, “Well, so I can tell you where the key is and the
money.” And I said, “Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>So, before I could, you know, hang up, he says, “Be sure and call me.” “Did
you say you was coming in today?” And I said, “Yes.” And when he said that,
that’s when it kind of scared me, so, I just hung—I say, “okay,” and I hung up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What were you scared about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. The way he talked. He didn’t talk like—he never did sound like
hisself to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you sure you were talking to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Well, I guess so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you ever talked to him before on the telephone?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, it sounded like him in one way, and when he went to talking,
you know, just saying the same thing two or three times, that is what—that is
when I asked him, you know, if I was talking to Mr. Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, there was some doubt in your mind as to whether it was Jack
Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir. It was a doubt in something wrong with him the way
he was talking to me. Other things—times I would have, you know, just laid
my work down and went ahead on.</p>

<p>I called my daughter and told her, and she said, “Well, are you going over
there now?” And, “No; he don’t sound right to me over the phone. I am
going to wait.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I want to get at is this, whether or not you can say
it was Jack Ruby that you were talking to but that he seemed different?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir; that was him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or whether or not he seemed so different that you were not
sure that it was Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir. It was him. I’m sure of that, but then he just was
indifferent. He sure did talk indifferent; yes, sir. He sure did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, did he tell you that he was going out, or that he would
be back around 2?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Said he was going out, he would try to be back by 2. That is
what he told me. He says, “You call me before.” That is what he told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you when he was going out, Mrs. Pitts?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No, sir; didn’t tell me, says, “I am going out.” That is what he
says, and I says to him, I says, “If you are going to have company or something”—I
says, “I can wait and come tomorrow.” He said, “Oh, no; you come
on.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you fix a little better for us the time that this conversation
took place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. It was after 8 o’clock, was way after 8, but just to tell the
<span class="locked">truth——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say “Way after 8,” you mean way after 8 on the
way to 9?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Well, I imagine somewhere around 8:30, then, I guess it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It wasn’t after 9?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No, sir; it wasn’t after 9.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How can you be sure about that? Is there anything that you
remember that makes you say it was not before 8 but afterward, and not
before 9?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Well, the children had the programs on Sundays, and I know
then that they was a, you know, singing, and that is why I know it was between
8—8:30 and 9.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was what I was trying to get at, get something that you
could identify so that you could fix the time that way.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go to church, perhaps, that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No, sir; I didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Children go to church?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No, sir; they—they was intending to go to church. One—you
see, one, I think, did go to Sunday school, but church.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did he go?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. That one going to Sunday school was ready and gone before
then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time does Sunday school begin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Well, Sunday school begins around, I think, 9 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, he had already gone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you <span class="locked">say——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Have to walk a little piece.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, does that help you to fix the time of the conversation
with Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Well, that program there, that is what <span class="locked">I——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What program was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Something on that KBOX program where those preaching, you
know, and having church there, and that is the reason I said it is between 8:30
and 9.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you first spoke to Mr. Ruby, did he seem to have just
awakened, or what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Well, I don’t know know if <span class="locked">he——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say he had just awakened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No; I didn’t ask him that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Mr. George Senator?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. I know of him. I cleaned for him twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He lived in the same apartment, or a different one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. He was living next door to him when I cleaned for him. He
was 206, and Mr. Ruby was 205.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s see. This apartment that you were going to clean on
November 24, what was the number of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. That was Mr. Ruby. In 205.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Sure it was not 207?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. That is it. He—206. Senator was right next door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Next door, or across?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No; right against Mr. Ruby’s, and, Senator—and Mr. George
Senator was right at—you’re right, 207. I keep saying 205, but it was 207.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. 207?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know whether or not Mr. Senator and Mr. Ruby were
sharing apartment 207 on November 24, or sometime before that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Well, I hadn’t been there in—and seen him. I hadn’t, but when
I had went there and cleaned—started to clean his apartment where Mr.
George used to live, and he had moved out, but when—where did he move
then, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, any Sunday you ever went to Mr. Ruby’s apartment, you
don’t know whether Mr. Senator was sharing that apartment or not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No; he would come over there when he lived right there next
to him, but, see, when he moved, well, then, I hadn’t been there in a long time,
so, then, I had seven vacant apartments to do just before this all happened,
so, then <span class="locked">I——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Mr. Ruby have a two-bedroom apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you noticed before that both bedrooms had been occupied
by people, that is to say, by cleaning up, by seeing that the beds had been
slept in and so forth, you can tell when the <span class="locked">rooms——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No; the bed was made. Now, the manager told me, but I didn’t
see him there. Now, the manager told me that they must—this man Senator
had moved over there, but then I didn’t see him there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He didn’t pay you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever talk to Mr. Senator over the phone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No, no. I—he called me from his apartment once and talked
to me about coming to clean for him, but he didn’t talk to me, Mr. Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it possible that the man you spoke to on November 24,
was not Mr. Ruby, but Mr. Senator?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. It sounded like Mr. Ruby, but he just—he started talking off
all right and then he would go, you know, to talking funny to me, and don’t
sound like himself, and hollering and talking loud and that is something he
didn’t ever do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean kind of mad at you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No; it wasn’t mad, but just talking strange, you know how a
person talks strange, kind of. Don’t really understand what they are really
saying, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You testified, didn’t you, in Mr. Ruby’s trial?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you been interviewed prior to that by his attorney?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Say had I been what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Interviewed prior to your testimony in the trial by his attorney?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir; by his—Mr. Belli.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Belli? He talked to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. He talked to me. He come out there and got me when I was
sitting out there waiting. They had—Mr. Burleson was the one that talks
to me over the phone and told me that I had to come down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ask you whether or not his voice was strange?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. They just told me to tell how he talked to me, so, that is what
I did. That is what he said that they wanted to know. So, that is what I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember that you were interviewed by Mr. Jack French,
special agent of the FBI, around 2 or 3 days after this shooting occurred?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall whether you told Mr. French at that time that
you thought that Mr. Ruby’s voice sounded odd the way you testified today?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir; I told him that, but he told me what he was wanting
to know if I had seen any books or letters or papers around there, and that
I didn’t ever look, <span class="locked">and——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you say you told Mr. French that you thought that Mr.
Ruby’s voice was odd like you testified to today?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir; I told him that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell him that, or was the first time that you testified
like that at the time of the Ruby trial?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Did I do what now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I say, are you sure that you told Mr. French about Mr. Ruby’s
strange sounding voice or <span class="locked">what——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. I <span class="locked">told——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or was the first time you testified about that voice at the time
of the trial?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. I told him some of it. He told me he wasn’t interested in that.
He said what he wanted to know if I’d seen a lot of people around there. I
didn’t see, because I wasn’t there every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it suggested to you by anyone that you should say that
his voice was strange there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir; I told him that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; did anybody suggest to you, at anytime that you should
testify that Mr. Ruby’s voice seemed odd that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No, sir; nobody didn’t tell me that, just told me to tell how he
talks to me, so, that is what I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you had also told that to Mr. French?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes; I told him he sounded funny to me and strange, and scare
me, and there is another reason I didn’t just drop my work at home and go
ahead home, because I could have went on to the store right there close and—but
I wouldn’t do it, because he talked so funny to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean you decided at that time that you weren’t going over
there that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. I guess when I talked to him—after I hung up I called my daughter
and told her about it, said, “He sure sounded funny to me.” And, so,
she said, “Are you going, mama?” And I said, “No.” And, directly my little
bitty granddaughter, the oldest granddaughter there, and they says, “Is this
name Jack Ruby, Rubinstein, or something?” And I said, “No; Jack Ruby.”
Says, “Well, that news is where—there he done killed a man.” But I said,
“Killed who?” So, she said—“Oswald.” Well, it didn’t—this Oswald, I don’t
know nothing about him, so, I said, “That isn’t him, because this is Rubinstein.
It’s Ruby is what he told me.” All I ever did know was Jack Ruby, so, I
called my daughter again, and I says to her, I says, “They’ll show that on
TV, and they call the dog Sheba”—there, that’s him, and I said, “You stay
there and look and call me back.”</p>

<p>I still kept working, because I didn’t think it was him, so, she—directly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
she called me and says, “Yes.” It is on TV and is a little, short, heavy man
kind of bald-headed, I say, “Yes.” And called me back and said where he
lived, and sure enough, and I said, I knowed there was something wrong with
that man. I didn’t go on over there—and was glad that I didn’t go. No doubt
when—went over there when he was talking the way he was talking he would
turned around there and shot me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Explain that a little bit. I don’t think you have told us much
about what he told you. As I understand your testimony he seemed a little
vague, but, he told you to come on and clean but call before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, he told you that he thought he would be back by 2
o’clock?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. He told me be sure and call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was strange about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Well, see, he asked me that two or three times, now, was I coming
over, and what was I coming over there for, and I had to tell him, and told
him that I was coming to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, it was several times, Mrs. Pitts?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That you had to identify yourself, as it were?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir; I told him who I was and told him, says, “I’m coming
to clean.” See, I had borrowed $25 from him a while back and paid him the
money back, and I thought when he asked me did I want some money I—and
says, “Oh, no; I don’t want to borrow no money today. I am coming to clean.”
Told him coming to clean today. Is so—it’s Sunday, you’ve always told me
to wait until Tuesday and then Saturday, and back to Sunday, and I says,
“And today is Sunday.” And he says, “Oh.” And I <span class="locked">said——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He says, What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. He says, “Oh,”—and I says to him, I says, “If you don’t want
me to come on, if you have got somebody—company or something, I can wait
and come tomorrow. I’ll wait and come tomorrow if you say so.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. <span class="locked">Well——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. “No, you come now, but you call me.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, was there anything else peculiar about the conversation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Then, he didn’t seem to know who I were at first. Turned and
says to me, says, “Are you coming over here? What you coming over here
for?” And I says, coming over to clean. I says, “Today is Sunday.” He
says, “well—I didn’t seem to think that I would have to tell him that.</p>

<p>“Come over to clean I will leave the keys for you and come and start, and
you can come on and clean,” and I said, “Yes, sir.” Well, then, I was getting
arrangements made to start and he turned to me again and say, “What you
coming for?” And I said, “Well, I’m coming to clean and dust.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He said that several times?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Also, some little sound in his voice you think?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you say something about his being kind of rude, now, or
rough?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No; he hollered and <span class="locked">something——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Hollered?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Hollered? What do you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. And in talking about these things, yes, sir, he says, “What you—what
are you—what do you want?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when you say a loud voice like you just raised your voice
right now.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. “What do you want?” and I says, “What you want?” And he
said, “Yes,”—said, “This is Elnora. I was coming to clean.” He says, “Elnora?
Who is Elnora?” Elnora Pitts. He mostly called me Eleanor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he curse you or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No, sir; he didn’t cuss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He just raised his voice and did not understand, you would
have to repeat things several times?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that bothered you so that you made up your mind you
weren’t going that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes; scared me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were fearful that he might <span class="locked">hurt——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. I didn’t think he might hear—that is, he might hurt me, but I
was scared something was wrong with him by him asking me that two or three
times and he never did ask me that. And I always would call him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. I would always call him and say I would be there. There was
going to be nobody there. At times he would be leaving and take the dog along
because I don’t work where there’s dogs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What dog?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Sheba. I’ve been dog-bit twice so, I am just scared of dogs, and
I don’t go where dogs is in the place, and that is the reason I refused to go
when the manager opened the door for me and told me she would put him in
the bathroom, and I told her I would go on home and come back again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have a gun in that apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. I never did see it. I never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he carry a lot of money?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. He did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Well, there would be on the coffee table top, dining room table,
on his dresser, be behind the dresser, on the floor. I would pick it up and put
in those things, brown envelope sacks and sack it up, and put it on the dresser.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Lots of money?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Well, I guess it was right smart, but it wasn’t no—way up in
the hundreds <span class="locked">or——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Rolls of money?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No; just loose money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was on several times that you noticed that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir; lots of times, because I refused to clean his dresser off,
and his coffee table, and the manager told me, said, “Jack Ruby said I had left
the coffee table and dresser, and I said,” “Do you know why?” And say, “No.”
“Because he had money laying all over both the table and on his dresser, and
on the table.” And I says—“and I don’t dust them, because I don’t—by him
being a Jewish man, I don’t want him to say I taken the money, you know. I
don’t steal, you know that.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. He says, “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Andrew Armstrong?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Now, he had a man staying there with him once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Colored man, I am talking about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. And—oh, Andrew? Well, I seen this Andrews down in the courthouse.
He had called out there several times when I was there, <span class="locked">and——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. While you were working?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir; this Andrews did, and he would ask for Ruby, and I
would tell him, you know, and whenever Ruby come in you tell him that I am
ready to go and he would just say, “Ain’t there some money laying around?”
And I said, “No, he can pay me himself. No, I’d rather for him to put it out
for me himself.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never met Andrew Armstrong?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. I seen him down at <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Court?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Courthouse, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you meet him then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you ever seen him before then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you know it was Andrew Armstrong you were talking
to on these previous occasions when you spoke to him on the telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. He told me who he was, Andrews.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you recognize his voice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir. I recognized his voice when I seen him up there and
somebody called him Andrews, and <span class="locked">then——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So the conversation you had prior to the time Mr. Ruby was
arrested, those conversations with Andrew were all over the phone and you
had never met him before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. See, I don’t have—I don’t have any conversations with Andrews
since Mr. Ruby been in jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand that the conversations you had prior to the time Mr.
Ruby went to jail, with Andrew, were all over the phone and it was at a time
you had never met him before, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. You mean when I was there working there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. And he would call and something would be wrong at the club,
and he’d call and say he needed Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. That’s right, and I’d say, well, he’s not here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had never met Andrew at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, you recognized his voice and subsequently when you met
him you recognized his voice, too?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. As I—I asked him, I says—somebody called him, and Andrew—and
I said, “Oh,”—I said, “You are the Andrew who used to call out at the
house.” And he says, “Yes.” Thought I was, at first, Alice, somebody by the
name of Alice, and I said, “Elnora.” Oh, yes, I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a girl by the name of Alice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No, sir; I didn’t know her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she live in the apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. That, I don’t know if she—I guess she must have worked at the
club. I think she worked down at the club. I never did see her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a lady by the name of Alice Nichols?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No, sir; I don’t know none of them people that worked down to
his place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, all right. Is there anything else that you know about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there anything you know about that you haven’t stated to me?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No, I never did go to his club. I have never met none of those
people there, <span class="locked">and——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there anything that you testified to in court that you haven’t
said here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No, sir; nothing. I told you the truth. Just testified the truth
on how he talked to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your testimony today is about the same as it was in court, is
that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know anything else concerning Mr. Ruby that would
throw any light upon why he shot Oswald, if he did, or what his connection was
with Oswald or with anybody else in any manner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. That is something I do not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You do not know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No, sir. I don’t even know this Oswald. I don’t know a thing
in the world about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a boy by the name of Larry Crafard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Well, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I will show you some pictures of a man here taken in
different poses. Have you ever seen that man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. I don’t think I have, no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let the record show that the witness was shown several—five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
pictures of Larry Crafard, also known as Curtis LaVern Crafard, and after
examining them, she stated that she did not know this man.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do I understand that you say you have never seen him at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. I don’t think I have. I don’t remember him. He had one young
man that stayed there, kind of tall boy. I don’t know his name, but I ain’t
seen him since Mr. Ruby been in jail down here, and he had moved over here
on—I believe he was—said it was Freeman’s Apartment House, I believe that
is where he lived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was his name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. I don’t know his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he live there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he live at the apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. The apartment—lived there with Ruby for one while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long ago?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Well, that was back in December. He was a tall, young looking
boy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is not the man I just showed you the picture of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. He don’t look like him; no. I don’t know his name. I seen
him there. I seen him one Sunday night. I seen him there and seen him there
once before then, but he didn’t say too much when he come in that Sunday
night. I was getting ready to leave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You only saw him twice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was thin, and tall, you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Well, he wasn’t a real thin boy, but he was tall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was tall? How old was he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. I don’t know just how old he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What made you think he was living there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What made you think he was living there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. This boy said he was. He was working down there at the club.
He told me he was working down there for his room out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was this a Jewish boy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. I don’t know. He come from somewhere here and <span class="locked">he——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The Dallas area?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. I guess and he didn’t have no job. He would work there to
pay for his room, is what the boy told me, but I didn’t pay too much attention
to him, because I was getting ready to go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You only saw him on two occasions?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was Mr. Ruby there when you saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Mr. Ruby, come in when I was getting ready to leave, and this
boy had some—and I think then he was telling the boy to get ready to go down
to the club and I was getting ready to go out the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You fixed that as being in the summertime?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then the boy left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir; he did. I don’t know. I guess it was summertime.
I don’t even know, but it was kind of hot weather. Might have been fall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he living there at the time Mr. Ruby got in the trouble?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Oh, goodness no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He had left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. He had been gone a long time. That was in the wintertime.
I don’t even know to tell you how much attention I paid to this boy. I didn’t
even know him when I come out of the drug store and I said something to one
of my middle granddaughters—got a paper and something, and boy turned
around and said, “Hello there.” And I looked at him, and then he—“Don’t
you remember me?” And I said, “Oh, yes, I believe I do now.” I says, “You
was living with Ruby?” And he says, “Yes, I thought sure you’d remember me.”
And I said, “Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. That was when Ruby had been in the trouble, and he was in the
street, and I come in the drug store, and he was stopping out there fixing to
get into his car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The drug store.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Corner of Cornell and Ewing, there. The drug store where he
was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know where that man works?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Work? No, no. I don’t know that. Mr. George Senator, now,
would know him, and could tell you where he is. I don’t even remember the
boy’s name, but I know—and into my work, and get through, and so, I never
seen but twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The time you saw him at the drug store, though, he was getting
into his automobile, was that after Mr. Ruby got into trouble?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long after, about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. I don’t know just how long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Around Christmastime or before the trial?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Well, yes; it was before the trial, as I had never been down here.
At least I hadn’t been down here, and I don’t know if he had been or not, but
he did tell me the FBI men had been out talking to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After New Year’s that you saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. I just don’t know how—when it was. Might have been after
New Year’s, but I know it hadn’t been down here, you know, at the trial. And
he said they had been out to talk to him and found him and talked with him,
so, I guess he told them, you know, where he was. Told me he was living over
at the Freeman’s Apartments, and I don’t know if he is still over there or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Once again, he doesn’t look like the man whose pictures I
showed you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, have you ever been interviewed by any member of
the Commission’s staff before? I am a member of the Commission’s staff, and
have you been interviewed by me before this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No, sir; I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you have never seen me before today, isn’t that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then there was no interview between you and me before we
began this deposition?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, Elnora, thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pitts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<h2 id="PRIDDY">TESTIMONY OF HAL PRIDDY, JR.</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of Hal Priddy, Jr., was taken at 5:05 p.m., on March 31, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Erway
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the
President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Mr. Hal Priddy [spelling] P-r-i-d-d-y,
Jr. Mr. Priddy, my name is Leon Hubert. I am a member of the advisory
staff of the General Counsel of the President’s Commission. Under the Provision
of Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, Joint Resolution
of Congress 137, and rules of procedure adopted by the Commission in conformance
with the Executive order and the joint resolution I have been authorized
to take the sworn deposition from you, Mr. Priddy, as the former employee of
the O’Neal Funeral Home.</p>

<p>I state to you now that the general nature of the Commission’s inquiry is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
ascertain and evaluate and report upon the facts relating to the assassination
of President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Oswald.</p>

<p>I state to you now, Mr. Priddy, that the nature of the inquiry is to determine
the facts you know about the death of Oswald and any other facts you may
know about the general inquiry. In particular the ambulance call at the
O’Neal Funeral Home. Now, you have appeared here today by virtue of a general
request made by Mr. J. Lee Rankin, General Counsel for the President’s
Commission, addressed to the O’Neal Funeral Home, and asked them to produce
certain documents and witnesses relevant to those documents and other matters,
I take it that you have not, yourself, received a copy of that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me say that under the rules of the Commission, any witnesses—any
witness is entitled to a 3-day written notice prior to the taking
of his deposition, but the rules also provide that a witness may also waive the
3-day notice if he sees fit, and I ask you now if you are willing to waive the
3-day notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you stand and be sworn. Do you solemnly swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you please state your full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Hal Arthur Priddy, Jr.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Twenty-five.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your residence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. 1857 Swan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your present occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Salesman for Shaw Jewelers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, on November 24, 1963, which was the Sunday after the
assassination of President Kennedy, where were you employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. O’Neal Funeral Home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In what capacity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. I was the rider. I was riding with Mike, but I just <span class="locked">relieved——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were riding with Mike whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Mike Hardin, and I just relieved the dispatcher, and he had
taken my place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was the dispatcher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Wayne Wolfe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, that you were acting as dispatcher around, say 11 or 11:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At the O’Neal Funeral Home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What are your duties as dispatcher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Well, we receive incoming calls from the police department and
in turn dispatch them to the various funeral homes in their district, you
<span class="locked">know——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean the O’Neal Funeral Home dispatches them, they
receive calls from the police office and dispatch these calls to the various
<span class="locked">funeral——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. You see, we have a direct line from the police department. All
they do is pick up a phone and it rings and we have a direct line to the Dudley
Hughes Funeral Home and to the Camp Funeral Home, so that if the call
is in their area that way the ambulance will get there quicker, you know, than
O’Neal’s having to drive clear across town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, O’Neal’s is sort of central for all ambulance
<span class="locked">calls——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which come to you from the police and in turn are sent out
by you to the appropriate funeral home operating an ambulance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I assume that you send the ambulance which is closest to
where it is needed?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, now, do you recall having received a call from the
police shortly after 11 o’clock on the 24th of November 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Yes, sir; I was dispatching at the time, and one of the other
funeral homes called and told me. I was waiting for the call when they told
me that they were going to have to have an ambulance down at <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You what? You were waiting for the call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Yes, sir; you see. One of the funeral homes had, you know,
it was on live TV, and they had seen it, and they picked up their direct line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. And told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Told you what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. That we were probably going to need an ambulance, that there
was a disturbance down at city hall, so, I was waiting for the call when it
came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I show you a document marked for identification as Hardin
Exhibit No. 5125, and ask if your handwriting appears on that document?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Yes, sir. Right here at the top of it where <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, in order that the record may show that we are both speaking
of the same document, I wonder if you would put your signature along with
mine and Mr. Hardin’s at the top of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you say that the handwriting at the top is in your hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see the word “Lee” and then something scratched out. “Oswald.
City jail to Parkland.” Why did you put that information there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Well, on any call we have to have the information, you see.
I didn’t get that information until they called in to clear. I didn’t know—well,
I did know, but normally I wouldn’t know who the patient is, and where
they were taking them to, because he might just taken him to Baylor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you just put the number of the car that <span class="locked">you——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Yes, sir. That is the first thing when you stamp it—you stamp
it—then you put the number of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I notice the word “Mike,” on the left-hand top, is that in your
handwriting, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. I don’t see it. Wait a minute. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Also notice a name on this document, Hardin Exhibit No. 5125,
printed, telephone number, and then written No. 19.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. You mean this printed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; that No. 19 there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. I can’t tell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, then, there is on Hardin Exhibit No. 5125, next to
the printed item “time called,” a stamped time—and the time stated there is
11:21, November 24. Can you enlighten us as to the meaning of that entry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Whenever I receive a call from the ambulance—from the police
department I stick this card in the machine, and it automatically stamps the
date and the time that <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What kind of machine is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Just a time machine like a timeclock, except it is made for these.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You slip a card in there and it automatically stamps the time.
You don’t have to hit it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. No; you just shove it in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How accurate is that timeclock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Well, it is as accurate as the police department clock. I mean,
they are synchronized.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How are they synchronized and—how often?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Don’t know the mechanism. I know a man comes out and they
are serviced regularly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. No, by the manufacturer; and I don’t know who that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know how often they are serviced for correction and
accuracy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, you all rely upon them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Yes, sir; we have never had any occasion to question <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us what happened about this particular call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Well, I got the call, and I stamped it, and then I was waiting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Got the call from whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. From the police department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do when you got it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Well, I checked my receipts, the other receipts to see who was
clear, see, we have two ambulances there and it turned out <span class="locked">that——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. That the ambulance that I dispatched, I don’t remember the name
of it—the number, but the one that I dispatched was coming back from veterans
hospital, and the—I knew that they were in—thoroughly close to downtown,
because I just had had a call from them. They called when they got to the
hospital and they were cleared, so, when the police department called I told
them that the—there was an ambulance on the air and they dispatched it <span class="locked">by——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell them that they could reach that ambulance by putting
the call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Yes, sir; they just, you know—what number was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Call? You mean the car number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. 605.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. 605.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That appears on 5125, and I should ask you, really, what that
means?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Yes, sir; 605.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You told them to call car 605 because it was on the air, and that
means he could be reached by calling him. Did you tell them that was the
closest one you could find?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Yes, sir. <span class="locked">Well——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the one you gave, in any case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. No—yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was the closest one you could find?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You knew that the people had previously, that is to say, Mike
Hardin in car 605, had previously cleared from the veterans hospital stating
that he was coming back to O’Neal, and you figured he was en route, and that
it would—be quicker to reach him that way, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Yes, sir; I had figured him about to the freeway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I notice there is something here also in the—apparently
timecard stamp code 6, 11:30, 11-24.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. That is when he arrived at the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How was that received?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. I monitor all of the police broadcasts while my ambulance is out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you heard that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you took the card and put it in the machine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I notice some empty spaces in between, could you tell us now
how that came about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. At the time I was monitoring this the telephone was ringing,
and people were running in and out, you know, confusion, and I didn’t hear
when they left the police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, therefore, you didn’t stamp it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. I didn’t stamp it, that’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The next thing you did here was the second code 6?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. This was the arrival at the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Arrival at the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And therefore, you put that stamp on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Yes, sir; sometimes due to radio interference you are not able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
to make out who is calling. The police department may, or if they don’t tell,
ask again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case that second <span class="locked">time——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. But, anytime you hear your ambulance you punch the code
that he is on; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did hear the ambulance call in that he had arrived <span class="locked">at——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. He called in the police department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you overheard that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On your monitor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then took the card out and slipped it into the machine
and it recorded 11:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know whose handwriting is on the lower left-hand of
<span class="locked">that——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Document, Hardin Exhibit No. 5126, next to “Oxygen,” sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. And I didn’t write the 12:30 here where he was clear at 12:30.
But that probably doesn’t have any significance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir. Mr. Priddy, have you been interviewed by any
member of the Commission’s staff other than myself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. No, sir; no one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Insofar as the interview with me is concerned, do you consider
that everything discussed in the interview has been brought up in this deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. That I can think of; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know of anything that was not brought up in this
deposition that is material to the general inquiry we had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Priddy</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, sir; I thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="REEVES">TESTIMONY OF HUEY REEVES</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of Huey Reeves was taken at 9:15 a.m., on March 27, 1964, in
the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon J. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President’s
Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Reeves, my name is Leon J. Hubert. I am a member of the
advisory staff of the General Counsel of the President’s Commission under
the provisions of Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, Joint Resolution
of Congress 137, under rules of procedure adopted by the Commission in
conformance with the Executive order and joint resolution.</p>

<p>I have been authorized to take the sworn deposition from you, Mr. Reeves.
I state to you that the general nature of the Commission’s inquiry is to ascertain,
evaluate, and report upon the facts relating to the assassination of President
Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>In particular as to you, Mr. Reeves, the nature of the inquiry today is to
determine all the facts you know about the death of Oswald and any other
pertinent facts you may have about the general inquiry.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Reeves, I think you are appearing here today by virtue of a request
made for you to appear in a letter sent to you by Mr. J. Lee Rankin, General
Counsel of the President’s Commission on the assassination of President Kennedy.
Do you have that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you please state for the record the date that the letter
itself bears and the post date of the envelope, if you still have the envelope?
First of all, what is the date of the letter?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. November 29—no—that’s not it. I don’t see the date on the
letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have the other one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No; I just brought one. It shows here March 23.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Apparently the letter itself is undated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes; it is undated, but that is when it was—March 23, I believe,
1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you are referring to the Post Office stamp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes; that’s the post stamp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s the stamp on the envelope itself and what does it show?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. It shows March 21.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From what place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you receive the letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Let’s see—it’s dated about the 22d or 23d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What day of this week was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Let’s see—just when I got that—Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday—I
must have gotten it Monday, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You got it Monday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes; I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of this week; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. I believe that’s correct—Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday—it was
either Monday or Tuesday—it could be Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you got it on March 23 or 24, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes, sir; I believe I got it the 23d because I begun to try to get
in contact with you the next day and I thought about calling you just as quick
as I could, just as quick as I got it, and I noticed on it that it weren’t until the
24th or 27th, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you got it, you think, last Monday, the 23d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Oh, no—the 23d—I don’t know when the 23d is, but I believe—this
was the 23d—I believe that was it, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, will you stand up and raise your right hand so that I
can administer the oath?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. [Complies.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you solemnly swear that you will testify the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Please state your full name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Huey Moses Reeves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Age—I was born April 7, 1912.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. I live at 2903 Reynolds Avenue, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your present occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Allright Auto Park. I am a night boss, night foreman for Allright
Systems.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where is that located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. It’s on Commerce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is the number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. 1208, but I was at 1320, but they changed me to 1208.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that the same company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. That’s the same company; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On November 23d, which was a Saturday, where were you
working?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Let me see; November 23d, I was working at 1320 Commerce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s Nichols Garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes—Nichols Garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What job did you have over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. I was same—nightman working all night at Nichols Bros., the
same as at the other place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What were your hours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. I worked from 7 to 7.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And on November 23, which was Saturday, you worked from 7
o’clock Saturday night until 7 o’clock Sunday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a nightclub called the Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes; it’s right next to where I work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you come to know him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Well, he parked in my place all the time. He was a regular
parker, you see, and Nichols Bros. is right there and his club was next to my
parking place. He would just drive in and park and go up in his place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you known him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Ever since I have been working there—I don’t know just how
long—probably a year and a half—I wouldn’t say—I don’t know just how
long—probably a year and a half—I wouldn’t say for sure—but to the best
of my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him every day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Every night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Every night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a lady by the name of Karen Bennett—they call
her Little Lynn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Is she a young girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I don’t know her age—she is—I would suppose a young
girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. There’s so many girls—now, if she works up there for Jack
Ruby, I know them when I see them, but their names, it seems to me like that
little Bennett girl may have been the one that fainted one night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Down in Ruby’s place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; in our lobby room. She came out of Jack Ruby’s place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. It was before Jack Ruby done that—before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; but how long before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Oh, it was probably a month or two—I wouldn’t know for sure,
because I wasn’t keeping up with the dates, you know. I guess they told me
her name—she’s from Fort Worth, I believe. There are so many girls work
up there for him. A lot of them park down in the place there but I just remember
them—the face, but not the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember getting a phone call from Jack Ruby on the
night of Saturday, November 23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes, sir; I guess it’s that same girl—he called me to give $5 to her,
I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what time was it; do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Probably 9 o’clock, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, tell us exactly what happened about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Well, she called Jack over the phone and wanted some money and
Jack said, “Well, I can’t come down right now.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know what he said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Well, that’s what he told me to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who told you to do that? He told you to do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just tell us what she said and what you could hear her say over
the phone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Well, I don’t remember her saying anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she call from your place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes, well, you see my office phone is in this office and she was in
the next phone—the pay phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. And then—let me see, now, I believe she called Jack to borrow
some money and then Jack called me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, how do you know that she called him to borrow some money.
Did she tell you so or did you overhear this?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. He talked to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When she was making the call on the telephone, you didn’t
know who she was calling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you do know she made a phone call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And after the phone call did she tell you anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; she didn’t say anything—Jack told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Wait a minute, she didn’t say anything to you after she made the
phone call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t know who she was calling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was she with anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. I don’t remember whether her husband was with her or not.
Let’s see, I didn’t think about having to go through this—I don’t just remember
whether her husband—it seems to me like her husband was with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there a man with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. There was a man with her, and I think it was her husband.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you introduced to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No; I wasn’t introduced to her—I seen the boy claiming to be
her husband—he’s parked in there when she worked up there—he would get out
of the car, you know, never did ask anybody their names. I just run the parking
lot. I think her husband’s name is Bruce. I’ve heard some of them call
him Bruce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what his last name is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Jack told me to let her have $5.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You said Jack told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. He said this—correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she come over into your office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. She was already on the phone, I believe, or he may have called
me—I don’t remember whether I called or she had phoned, and anyway he said
to let her have $5, and now, I think, he said he would bring me down the money
and make her sign a receipt, which I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know whether or not you just got on the same phone
she was talking on or whether Ruby called you separately; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. I don’t remember—it seems to me like he called me separately
on my phone. You see, this is a little distance—he would call me after he
would get home and tell me to go see if he locked his door in the club—he thought
he might have left it open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he say when he called again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. To take this $5 and let the girl—I can’t think of her name—but
let the girl have the $5 and have the girl sign a receipt and I did, and he came
and gave me the $5 and he picked up the receipt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know you were talking to Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes—well, I knew his voice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have talked to him on the phone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes; lots of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you thought it was Jack Ruby, now, did he tell you—he
said he was Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have no doubt you were speaking to Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; no doubt but what it was him at all—no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was the extent of your conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes, just the $5—let her have $5 because he wasn’t ready to come
down, and I let her have the $5 and made her sign her name, just like he said,
and he got in a little bit later and gave me $5 and took the receipt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What kind of a receipt was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Just a little piece of paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you date it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes; I believe I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember whether you put a time stamp on it or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. I don’t believe I did—I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have a timeclock there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You just slip in a piece of paper and it automatically notes the
time of day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes, just a piece of paper you put in there, and it stamps the
time on it, but I don’t remember whether I did it or not on this—it was a piece
of paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She signed it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes, she signed her name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And, this was the receipt—do you remember what it said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; I believe I just said “Received $5—by Jack Ruby” or
“Received $5” and let her put her name—I don’t remember whether I put Jack
Ruby’s name upon that or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that’s the record of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes, that’s the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. It was probably about 9 or 9:30—I don’t remember exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you said a moment ago that sometime after that Ruby
came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes, he came in—it was probably 30 minutes or an hour or something
like that; I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, tell us what happened then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Well, he just came in and says, “Here’s your $5,” and he never
did anything about the receipt and I handed him the receipt, just like I said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he do with the receipt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. I imagine he put it in his pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t see him put it in his pocket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, I didn’t see him—I wasn’t paying any attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was his condition when he came in that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Not paying no attention to Jack Ruby—I didn’t pay him attention—no
attention to him, walking around in my place or coming into my office
then—I was busy and didn’t pay no attention to him. You know, he’s in there
all the time parking his car, and when he come out of his club lots of times he
would walk around and into the office and talk to them that way, and he would
say a few words, and if he went out for sandwiches he would always ask us if
we needed any sandwiches or drinks or anything like that. He was an awful
nice fellow—awful nice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you notice whether he seemed to be crying or upset about
anything that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; I didn’t—I didn’t pay any attention to him, but he seemed
like—too, you see, I was in the office now, and the guy’s lounge was back in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whose lounge—what lounge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. The lounge in the office, and then the Saturday morning, it seemed
like, too, he would go back in the waiting room and prance—walk around more
than usual, but he always did walk around—he had hard heels on, and you could
hear him walking when he would come out of his club. I would be sitting in
the office, maybe figuring up my back receipts, and I would hear him tapping
those heels and I would say, “It’s Jack Ruby, because he is coming out of his
club.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say this night he was walking a little bit more than usual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes; it seemed like he was a little bit more restless.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you talk to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; I didn’t pay any attention—I never thought much about
it, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you tell whether he was crying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; I really didn’t pay any attention to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The only thing you noticed about his general conduct that night
that was different from other nights was that he seemed to be walking around
a little bit more?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. It seemed like he was a little bit more restless or something, and
I believe that night, too, he had his club closed. I believe that sign—I believe
he had a sign, if I remember, I really wasn’t interested in his club. I had a
pretty good job working for Allright—it’s a pretty busy place, but it seemed to
me like he had it closed. I believe he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you talked to Ruby earlier that day or seen him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Let’s see, I came to work at 7; it seemed to me like that Ruby
was there when I got there. It seemed like he drove up and then he left and
then came back, it seemed like, and that’s when he must have went home and
this girl called him and then he was at home and he wasn’t ready yet. It
seemed like he told me he was waiting on a call or something from somebody or
something and he told the girl he wasn’t ready to come down, or he told me he
wasn’t ready to give her the $5, you see, and he told me to give her the $5 and
to make out a receipt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And have you to give it to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. I had given her the $5 for him and I knew it was good because
he always paid me back if he owed me any parking—he always paid it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you ever paid any employees money like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; that there was the only one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. While you were on the phone with him, did he tell you that he
was at home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Let’s see, I don’t believe he said where he was. He just said he
had an appointment or had a caller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you didn’t call him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Either he called you or you got on the phone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When the girl had been talking to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Or he called me, you know, I don’t remember just exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you are certain he didn’t tell you he was at home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; he didn’t say where he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did get the impression that he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes; that’s right, just my impression he was at home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what that impression is based on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it on anything he said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; he didn’t say anything about where he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But he did say he couldn’t come because he was waiting for a
call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. He was either waiting for a call or wasn’t ready or something to
come down, I believe is what he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did he leave, you say, just about the time you came
on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. I believe he went away about the time I came to work, I believe
he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You saw him when he left, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes; you see his car is parked there all the time, right in front
or his side by his club, that was in parking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, about 7 or shortly thereafter he left the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. I sort of believe he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the next time you saw him was when he came back in just
about a half hour or so after you gave the $5 to this girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes; and he brought my $5 back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember when he left after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. It seems to me he fooled around in the lobby, in the back waiting
room there a while and pranced around or walked around and drove off—where
he went from there, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him any more that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Let’s see, it seems to me he came back down there that night
and fooled around the lobby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he park his car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. You see, he always parked his own car—we didn’t park his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He had a special spot there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes; he had a special spot there. We could move it up and
down, because he would leave his key, and we could move it up and down as
we had to move it in parking, but it seemed to me like he left again to go—he
was going home, and I told Mack, the colored man that worked for me, I
said, “That looked like Jack Ruby’s car that went up the street.” You see,
I sit on Commerce Street and I can tell every car that passed if I just wanted
to look out, and it seemed to me, I told Mack that that looked like Jack Ruby’s
car that went back up the street, up Commerce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He didn’t have to check in with you to get his car out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; he was a monthly parker, he paid by the month. When
his car was parked there, nobody fooled with it, because he was a monthly
parker. You see, the drive came in this way [indicating] for all the ticket
cars, and over here on the side, was his parking place. Of course, we might
park two or three in front of his, but sometimes we would move his if a boy
had to sweep or something, we would have to move his car up and down and
back and forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time was it, about, that you saw him leave again and
made a comment to that effect to the colored boy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. It seems to me like when he left he said, “I’m going home,”
and I told Mack, it looked to me Jack Ruby was going back up the street and
he said he was going home when he left, and, told me earlier, “Boy, I’m going
home.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say usually he went out to his room in Oak Cliff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. And I told the boys, “That looked like Jack Ruby’s car that
went back up the street.” That might not have been him—there’s lots of cars
that looks like that, but that’s what I told Mack Jones, the colored man there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. It was probably 9:30 or 10 or maybe 10 or over, I wouldn’t say
for sure, but I would just sort of estimate the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was after he had given you the $5 back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, he didn’t stay in the club very long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; I don’t remember him ever going up in the club that
night. I don’t think he even went up in the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, he just came and gave you the $5, picked up
the receipt and left pretty quick?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes; it seemed to me like he came back again and fooled around
in the lobby lots—he would come back and fool around at the garage and my
colored man was a good friend of his and he always talked a lot to Jack Ruby—he
talked to him and I was a good friend to him, too, on account of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him any more than that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; that’s the last time I have seen him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The last time you have seen him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes; I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t see him Sunday morning before you went off duty,
did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; I sure didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him earlier on Saturday, the day after the President
was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Saturday after the President was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, you were off on Saturday morning until 7 that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes; I am off in the daytime—I’m just there at night—I couldn’t
tell you whether I saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him on Friday night during your shift, which ran
from 7, November 22, Friday night, to 7 o’clock Saturday morning, November
22–23, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. I can’t recall that in there so much. I wouldn’t want to say
for sure whether I seen him or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember his making any comment to you on—about
the shooting of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; no, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Andy Armstrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. He is a colored man that worked for Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long had he been there, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. I think he was there—I think when he came there—it was probably
a year and a half or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you talked to him since Ruby was arrested on November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. I probably have. He worked, you know, running the club, but
I never did have anything to do with him. You see, I was always so busy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you know he was running the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Well, he worked up in the club, I would see him up in the club
and the girls all parked right down there with me, and he worked up in the
club. They claimed he was sort of the guy that run it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean after Ruby was arrested or before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. After.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never did talk to the man about the shooting on the 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; none.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Andy Armstrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Ralph Paul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you known him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. I have known him when I seen him; he parked in there, too, and
would go to Jack Ruby’s place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How often would he go, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Sometimes he would come in there, say two or three times a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he park by the month?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; a ticket on the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how long would he stay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Sometimes he would come and stay 3 or 4 hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was two or three times a week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever talked to him since November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; the only thing is, when he pays the ticket, I get his
car for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you have never talked to him about Ruby since November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; I don’t believe he ever mentioned to me about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of George Senator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes; I have seen that man there, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he park his car in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes; he has parked in there, too; he worked for Jack some.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he on a monthly basis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; a ticket car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you describe him for us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. George?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Well, he’s sort of a heavy set—a pretty big heavy set man, I
guess, about 5 feet 8 inches tall, or something like that, and weighs probably
175 to 180 pounds, a pretty good size man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Bald headed, or slightly bald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. I believe he’s got pretty good hair on his head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever notice any limp on him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Limp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Limp—yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Ralph Paul have a limp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. I don’t believe he did. I don’t believe he limped—no, sir; not
as I know of. Well, Paul broke his foot after all that happened, but you know,
he went around in a cast on his foot with crutches for a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, when was that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. That’s since, you know, all that happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was after the 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes; he broke his foot; I don’t know how it happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever talked to George Senator about Ruby since the
24th of November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; I don’t believe he’s been in my place since then. I don’t
believe he has.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Larry Crafard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; I don’t believe I know him—no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I will show you some pictures of a man, there are several
of them there in different poses, and I would like for you to look at them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. [Examining pictures referred to.] Yes, I have seen this guy
there at Jack’s place. He worked for Jack some.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let the record show that the witness is examining five photographs
of different poses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Let’s see, I believe this is the same guy that worked—let’s see
some of these—I don’t know for sure, but I believe it is the same one, too, I
believe. All of these look like the same man to me, do they to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They are all five different poses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. They look like the same man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes. These are all five different poses of Curtis Laverne Crafard,
taken on November 28, 1963, by the FBI and forwarded recently to the
Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. He stayed up there with Jack Ruby some.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you identified this man as a man you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Well, I don’t exactly know him—he worked for Jack Ruby and
he would come down to the window and chat with me—right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know his full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; I don’t ever remember his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did he work for Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Well, I would see him up there and when Jack would leave, he
would leave him in his place to guard it, guard his place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Well, I have seen him leave with Jack Ruby and Ralph Paul
and go off with them in the car, you know, at night, after they closed the place
up. I think they called it going to eat or something. I have seen him leave
with them two or three times in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you say he slept there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes; he stayed in the place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Well, I would see him go close the door and go up in there and
go over to the Eatwell Cafe and hang around maybe an hour or so and go up
there and lock the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you figure he was staying there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ever tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. It looked like he was working for Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ever tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes, that he was living upstairs—yes, staying there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did he stay up in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. It seemed to me he stayed there a couple of weeks or something
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was the last time you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. It seems to me he disappeared—well, he disappeared. I never
did know any more of him—I don’t know whether Jack fired him or he just
walked off. You know how it is around one of them garages—I just seen him
there and see people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him during your night shift from 7 o’clock on Friday,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
November 22, that’s the date the President was shot, until the end of your
shift at 7 o’clock the next morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. November 23d? Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I’m talking about the man whose picture you just looked at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. I don’t believe I did—I don’t believe I seen him around there
during that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him and Ruby in the early hours of the 23d,
Saturday, say about 3 or 5 o’clock in the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; I don’t believe I did—no, sir. I don’t think I seen him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see Ruby that morning, I’m talking about the shift
that runs from 7 o’clock on Friday to 7 o’clock Saturday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Let’s see—what date was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It would have been the 22d and the 23d, that was the night of
and the morning after the President was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir. Let’s see, I may have seen Jack—I don’t remember
seeing this boy. I may have seen Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember Jack parking his car there early Saturday
morning the 23d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Saturday morning the 23d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Before you got off, maybe 2 or 3 hours before you got off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; I don’t think so. He never did come in that early—before
I got off—I don’t think so. Most of the time he came in would be, I
think, about 8 o’clock at night and maybe when he closed up was 1 or 1:30
and he would maybe go off and eat and he might run back to see if he locked his
door. Sometimes he would call me and have me to hold the phone while I ran
in there to see if his door was locked, and I would come back and tell him his
door was locked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say it just looked like Larry had taken off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Well, I seen him going in and out of the place there all of the
time—I just missed him. I was not trying to keep up with him—I just
missed him. I was not trying to keep up with him, but I just missed him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember when you missed him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did anybody tell you he had gone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; didn’t nobody tell me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the last time you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; I couldn’t say for sure the last time I seen him. I
think he stayed there a week or 2—I don’t remember—it might be 3 weeks—I
don’t remember. Sometimes he would come in, he was a pretty friendly boy, and
he would come there and wave at me and I am pretty friendly too and I would
see him when he was working up there for Jack Ruby and maybe I would wave to
him when he came out and sometimes he would come over there and talk
to me at the ticket window while I was cashing tickets and chat with him a
few times, but I don’t remember him ever telling me his name or anything,
but he was a peculiar acting kind of a boy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In what way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. The way he would sort of bat his eyes like that when he
would talk and get around real fast when he would take off up the street.
He would walk real fast, you know, and all at once he would just take off
and go through the Adolphus Hotel lobby, is what I mean. He claimed he
had a girl friend over there—I don’t know who it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Over there at the Eatwell Cafe—some girl was meeting him
over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes, he said, “I’ve got to go, I’ve got to meet a girl over at the
Eatwell.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see him with a girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; I never seen him with a girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where is the Eatwell place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. It’s on Main Street, right in front of Nichols Brothers. You
go through the lobby of the hotel—I call it a lobby, I always say lobby, but it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
just a car drive, and you run into Main Street and it is up two or three doors,
and it’s the Eatwell Cafe. It stays open all night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It’s on Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you that the girl worked there, or that he was
just meeting her there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. He said he was going to meet her. I don’t know whether she
worked there or was just meeting him there, I just don’t know. He said,
“I’ve got to go and meet her.” I would talk to him a few times—he was
friendly—he would say, “I’ve got to go and meet a girl.” Whether he has
one—he seemed to be sort of a windy guy in talking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did that happen once or more than once?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. I believe once or twice—I would say probably a couple of
times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did anybody tell you he just took off and left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir; nobody didn’t say anything. I just seen him working, because
Jack had a lot of boys like that working for him. He had one boy that
worked before this time for him, a Jewish-looking boy, a stocky-looking boy.
The fact of the business is, Jack and him had a little trouble, and when they
were having trouble up in the place, they came down to where I could see
him out in front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was having trouble?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. This boy—I don’t know his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean the Jewish-looking boy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. He was a Jewish looking—little short type guy, and Jack—they
was having trouble and Jack went up in the club and he came down and I
heard the boy say, “I’m going to go get a gun and kill Jack Ruby,” and when
Jack come back down, I told Jack, I said, “Go back there and hide somewhere,
he’s got a gun and he’s going to kill you,” and Jack raised the turtle shell of
his car there in the parking lot and got his gun out and he went up to that
whisky store and hit him across the head with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What whisky store?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Right there up at the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You saw him do it yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No; I stayed out at the garage, but I heard the boy say,
“I’m going to get a gun and kill Jack Ruby,” and he said it real down low,
and when Jack came down, I didn’t want Jack to get killed, and I said, “Go
back there and hide. That boy said he was going to kill you.” Instead of
hiding like I told Jack, Jack reached back up in his car and got his six-shooter
out and went up to this whisky store and tapped him with his gun like that
[indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. It was when he went up to the store and I seen the big guy
come out across there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long ago was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. It has been probably 5 or 6 months—I wouldn’t say for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did the police come?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did anybody arrest Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. He didn’t bother Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old a man is this boy—this Jewish boy Jack was supposed
to have hit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. He looked like 30 years old or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where is the liquor store?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. It’s right up there on the corner. I believe I may have the address
here in my pocket—it’s the first one on the corner—Segal’s—I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What corner is it on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. It’s on the corner of Akard and Commerce—that’s it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time of night did this happen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. It was probably—I don’t remember just exactly, probably about
10:30, 9:30 or 10:30, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack Ruby come back right away after that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes, he came back to his place, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Right away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. It wasn’t too long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It wasn’t too long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, it wasn’t too long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he arrested?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was the other man arrested?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. I don’t think they arrested him neither. I think they carried
him to the hospital in an ambulance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see the ambulance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes, I heard the ambulance come after him and after he did that,
he come back and worked for Jack. Jack buddied up with him again, Jack was
a good-hearted kind of a fellow, and he came back and worked for him some
more, and went away. I never did learn his name, but some of them said he
lived in Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You think that was about 6 months ago from now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes, I wouldn’t say for sure—it’s either—might have been 3 or
4 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, we are now in March, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, if you say 6 <span class="locked">months——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. It seems to me like it might have been over 4 months—4 or 5
months—I don’t know for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You think it was in October or November of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Let’s see, it must have been in about September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. September 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. I wouldn’t say for sure now, but it was, all I know is I just
remember being—it scared me, you know. I was scared, you know, I didn’t want
Jack—some kind of unknown guy to come along and kill him, a guy just working
for him, and I heard him say it, and I told Jack. What I wanted Jack to do
was go back there and hide until the boy got in a good humor, you see.</p>

<p>Jack Ruby—seemed—he was always a nice fellow to me and I wasn’t thinking
about him being rough enough to do something like that. I really wasn’t,
because I never thought no more about Jack Ruby coming around in the garage,
coming in my office around there talking to me—he came around a lot of times
late at night. He maybe would stop by and say a few words and he treated me
just like a baby. He would bring me sandwiches and things like that and I
figured he was just a nice fellow, you know, is all I could figure out.</p>

<p>Now, he had a good many—I don’t remember—it seems to me like he had
several more. If there was anybody that came into town that was broke and
Jack knew it, he would take them in and get them some clothes and feed them
and give them some money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know all that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Well, I would see him doing it. Whether the guy was all right,
I don’t know. They was strangers to me. I was working for the Allright Co.,
worked 12 hours a night and have been for 2 or 3 years and I was just seeing
things—seeing people doing it and I thought he was running a legitimate place.
I knew I was running a perfect place, the parking system, and we’ve got lots of
customers, and you know, people parking in our place, going up to his club,
parking in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, Mr. Reeves, is there anything else you know about
this—any other facts that might throw some light on the assassination of
President Kennedy or the shooting of Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Nothing that I know of, because I didn’t know Oswald. If I ever
seen him, I don’t remember. The only thing, after I seen his picture in the
newspapers and come out on the television with the pictures and all, it seemed
like his face got familiar, but I never seen him before that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say you have seen pictures of Oswald in the paper and all
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. That’s right, and on television.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that you formed the impression that maybe you had seen
him before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir—well, it does seem like, you know, he got familiar
as I seen him on television and in the paper, but as far as seeing him before,
I mean before that happened, I don’t think I ever did see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think he has any resemblance, does he look like this
man Larry Crafard, this man I just showed you a picture of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Well, I don’t think he favors him any—seeing him in the pictures,
but I wouldn’t think so—no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever been interviewed by any members of the Commission
staff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. By an FBI man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, you haven’t been interviewed by me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Before this deposition this morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you very, very much, Mr. Reeves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. I’m sure glad to tell facts if I knew anything, I would just be
glad to help, because I would be glad to help, because President Kennedy
was one of my best friends. I liked him better than any man on earth—I
sure did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you very much, Mr. Reeves, for coming.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reeves</span>. Sure glad to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you, that’s all.</p>

Leon Hubert. I am a member of the advisory staff of the General Counsel of
the President’s Commission. Under the provisions of President Johnson’s Executive
Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, the joint resolution of Congress

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. WBAP-TV.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been so occupied?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Thirteen years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is the function in general of a TV engineer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Well, it is all phases of operation of TV equipment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you on duty with the remote truck of WBAP-TV in Dallas
on November 23 and 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was the truck parked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. It was parked on Commerce Street facing east.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, facing what street? Pearl or North Express?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. I don’t know really. It was on the left-hand side of the street
facing east, right in front of the city hall, or whatever it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know where Harwood Street is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Harwood? No, sir; I am not very familiar with the streets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How far away from the corner was the back of your truck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Oh, I would say 40 or 50 feet, approximately. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much room was there between the front of the truck and
the street curbing forming part of the entrance or exit from the police department
into Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Oh, 15 or 20 feet, I imagine. It wasn’t too far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you on duty on the 23d of November? That is to say,
Saturday, November 23, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was the position of the truck that you have just described different
on the 24th than that which you have described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. No, sir; it was moved in and left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Stayed there both days?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What hours were you on duty on the 23d? That is to say,
Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. I don’t remember exactly what time we got over there. I think
we had a 6 o’clock call from here, from Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Six in the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes. And I think we would have pictures by 8 o’clock, so I
would say we were there somewhere around 6:30, I imagine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. It was till late that night. I am not sure of the time. I believe
it was around 8 or 9 o’clock, that night, but I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you went home, you left the equipment where it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. That was on Saturday; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you go back to work on Sunday, the 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Sunday, I think I’m mixed up here. Sunday was the morning we
had a 6 o’clock call. Saturday morning is the day we moved in early. We had
a 1 o’clock call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. One o’clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you worked from 1 in the morning until about 8 Saturday
night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. It was rather not that Saturday night. We got back about 6:30
on Sunday morning. Saturday night is the night we stayed late.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now prior to the 23d, or the 24th, did you know a man by the
name of Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. No; I never heard of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Never seen him before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Never heard of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see Jack Ruby or a man that you have now come to believe
was Jack Ruby or know was Jack Ruby on the 23d or the 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Not on the 23d, but on the 24th, that would be Sunday, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now would you tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Well, the man that I think was him and I am positive, pretty sure
in my own mind it was, he was just out on the street alongside the truck in front
of the building, the city court building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he in the street in the sense that the place where the automobiles
were, or on the sidewalk alongside the building? On the left side of the
truck then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Between the left side of the truck and the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. I was on top of the truck with a camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Well, the time that I saw him was, I would say, in the neighborhood
of 8 o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there any way you fix the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Not definitely, because we were busy lining up cameras, and I
didn’t really pay much attention to the time, but I would say it was somewhere
in that neighborhood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened between the two of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Nothing, as far as I was concerned. I just saw him out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear him say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. No, sir; I never did hear him say anything, because it was cold
and I had a coat pulled up over my ears.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How was he dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. He had on a sort of grayish topcoat and sort of a gray-looking
hat, and he didn’t look like, you know, he didn’t look very neatly dressed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have a tie on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. I don’t recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have an overcoat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Topcoat; overcoat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You think that was about 8 o’clock, in the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. The first time I saw him was somewhere in the neighborhood of
8 o’clock. I am not positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember how long he stood around there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Well, I saw him again sometime, I would say, around 10 or a
little before 10, and he was down past the ramp this time that goes into the
building—basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you mean he was down past in the sense that he had progressed
ahead of the front of your truck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes, sir; he was down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The Commerce Street entrance was between your truck and
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there anything that drew your attention to him then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. No; not really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he dressed in the same way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. At this time he was still dressed the same way. That was the
last time I saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Those two occasions were roughly separated by about 2 hours,
you think?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Somewhere around there; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t know it was Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. No; I had no idea. I just thought he was a newsman, because
there were several out there walking around, and they moved the people across
the street, and he was one of the few that was left.</p>

<p>This person was one of the few that was left out there, and that is one reason
I thought he was a newsman, because they weren’t bothering the newsmen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him talk to any of the police that were stationed
along there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. No, sir; I didn’t see him talk to anyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You said that the second time was about 10 o’clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there any way in which you fix that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. No, sir; not really. Well, it was about the time that we thought
they were to bring Oswald out. I think they told us it would be about 10
o’clock. It was in that time period that we were sort of looking for them to
bring him out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Judging from the time that Oswald was actually shot or measuring
from that time backward, could you tell us how long it was from the time
Oswald was shot, backward until you saw Ruby; or to put it another way, how
much time elapsed from the last time you saw Ruby until Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. It was an hour or better.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now can you tell us when was the very first time you associated
that man that you have just described as having seen at 8 o’clock and again at
10, or a little better, with Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. It was that night when I saw the rerun of the tape that was
made. And when I saw him, it looked like the same man that was dressed
differently, to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now did the reruns show his face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Not too good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see any mug shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. I saw still shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you see those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. The next day, I believe; whenever the papers came out. It was
the pictures in the Dallas Herald, I believe, the big full-page picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Ira N. Walker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he on duty on the same truck with you that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I think <span class="locked">Mr.——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Johnny Smith.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Johnny Smith was too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall being in the company of them and seeing mug
shots relatively shortly after the shooting of Oswald on TV?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. No, sir; I didn’t see those. They were in the truck where they
could see the pictures, but I was out on top of the truck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you aware that they had seen the Ruby mug shots and had
associated them with the man that they had seen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. I don’t know. I don’t believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, when you saw the rerun, you independently
reached the opinion that it was Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was not suggested to you by the fact that Walker and Smith
had seen mug shots right after the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t know that they had seen the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now have you seen Jack Ruby since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Not in person; no, sir. I have seen pictures, newsreels, but
I haven’t seen him actually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have seen pictures of him in the newspapers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Newsreel films?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your opinion now as to whether or not the man that you
have described that you saw twice on November 24, at about 8 and then again
about 10 on Commerce Street is or is not the man that you now know from having
seen pictures and so forth, as Jack Ruby?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. I still believe that it is the same man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were not asked by the State to testify in the case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. No, sir; they came and talked to Johnny and Walker and myself
but they never did call me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your opinion as to your identification of the man on the
street and Jack Ruby as being the same man relative to your identification of
him on the reruns as opposed to your identification of him from the still photos
and other pictures that you have seen of him thereafter?</p>

<p>What I am trying to get at is, which one of the subsequent views you had of
Jack Ruby is stronger in your mind with reference to identifying the man that
you saw in the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. The still pictures, except for the difference in clothes. The
clothes in the still pictures look different from the ones that this person had
on that I saw, but I would say the still pictures looked more like him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nevertheless, it is a fact, that when you saw the reruns on the
night of the 24th, at that time you had an impression that it was the same
man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that a spontaneous thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes; when I saw it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you say anything to anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. My wife, I believe, because we were watching the news.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t report it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Richey, I have in hand here a document which purports to
be a report of an interview of you by FBI Agents Haley and Madland on December
4, 1963, which I have marked for identification as follows: “Fort Worth,
Texas, April 15, 1964, Exhibit 5316, deposition of Warren E. Richey,” and I have
signed my name on it.</p>

<p>I would like you to read the statement first, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. [Reads statement.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, sir, you have read this document that I have identified as
Exhibit 5316, and I will ask you if it substantially represents the truth as to
the interview between you and the Federal agents, or if you have any deletions,
corrections, or any amendments to make about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. I would say it was all approximately right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I invite your attention to the fact that this Exhibit 5316, states
that the <span class="locked">time——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. The time is different on there, but I tell you there has been a lot
happened since then that I couldn’t be too exact on the time, really, because this
was just, I don’t know, wasn’t too long after this all happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. For example, this statement mentions that you saw him about 9
o’clock and apparently doesn’t cover what you testified to. That is to say, that
you really saw him twice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Well, I actually didn’t see him twice. This was a period of time
really from approximately 8 or somewhere in there up until about 10 o’clock.
He wasn’t there early. That wasn’t what I meant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s get that straight. You saw him only once; is that correct?
Or twice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Well, I saw him—I don’t know how to put it. It was a period
of time I saw him, between this time, probably several times walked down
the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He walked actually between the truck and the sidewalk side of
the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then at one time you have a mental impression of having seen
him beyond the Commerce Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes, sir; from the corner. I don’t even remember what street.
It runs in front of the court building back of the truck. But he was within
that area from that street up beyond the ramp. But this last time I saw him
was at the ramp. But he was in between there several times that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Between 8?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. And 10 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you think that the very last time that you saw <span class="locked">him——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Was around 10 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What fixes 10 in your mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Like I say, it was about the time they were expecting them
to bring Oswald down in the building. That was when the chief of police
told us they would be bringing him out, and we were looking for him, because
I was up there on a camera, with a camera on the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you gotten any kind of alert standby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. No, sir. There was no alert of any kind. It was just the time
that they had given us the night before, actually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Anyhow, you say that your recollection is that the last time
you saw him, which was when you saw him beyond the Commerce Street ramp,
was approximately an hour or a little better from the actual shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the last time you remember seeing him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. That was the end of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he seem at that time to be walking away from your truck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. No, sir; he was standing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was just standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. He was standing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see any police near him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. No, sir; not near him. They had one policeman out on the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But when you saw him, it was after all the crowd had been
moved over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. They were across the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From the side of the street where your truck was, to the
opposite side of Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there many other people like this man walking around
in that area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. There was just occasionally newsmen, because they were congregating
in the basement and they would come by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But this man whom you have identified as Jack Ruby; did he
have any kind of paper or press badge which you observed in the nature of
a press badge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. No, sir; not that I saw, because there was a lot of newsmen
that didn’t have passes. Some of our crew didn’t even have passes, WBAP.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember when the armored truck pulled in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that before or after the last time you saw the man you have
identified as Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. I believe that was the—I believe the armored truck pulled
in after I saw him the last time, because there was one pulled in and backed
in, and the other one parked on the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You think that the last time you saw Ruby was before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Before any of that happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Before any of that happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes, sir; I believe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; Mr. Richey, have you been interviewed by any member
of the President’s Commission prior to this occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you anything else to say in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. No, sir; I don’t know of anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you said that you really didn’t hear Ruby say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I notice that this statement which has been identified as 5316—let
me ask you: You were interviewed by the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes, sir; that was 2 or 3 days, I believe, after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were interviewed at the same time as Mr. Walker and Mr.
Smith?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes; and there were some others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that an individual interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Not in our case. We were all together in the studio of WBAP.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You weren’t taken aside separately and individually?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Not when the FBI talked to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Each of you gave your story and the FBI agents made notes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ever ask you to check the notes or any draft?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. No, sir; I have never heard or seen them since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were on duty with the truck during the day of Saturday,
November 23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would it be possible that the man you saw and identified as
Jack Ruby would have been seen by you on the 23d rather than the 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. No, sir; I don’t recall seeing anyone that even looked like him
on the 23d. That one morning is the only morning that I recall seeing anyone
that even looked like him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On the 24th, I think you testified the crowd had been moved
over on the other side of the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had that been done on the 23d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. No, sir; no one bothered. There weren’t too many around on
the 23d. Mostly newsmen was all that was around on the 23d. There wasn’t
any crowd, really, but they started congregating on Sunday morning on both
sides of the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was after they had begun to congregate that you saw this
man you have identified as Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Richey</span>. Yes, sir; and then they moved the other people across, and I
still saw him after they moved the other people across the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir. Thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="SLAUGHTER">TESTIMONY OF MALCOLM R. SLAUGHTER</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of Malcolm R. Slaughter was taken at 7:30 p.m., on April 16,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of
the President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Slaughter, my name is Leon Hubert. I am a member of
the advisory staff of the General Counsel of President Johnson’s Commission
on the Assassination of President Kennedy. Under the provisions of Executive
Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, and Joint Resolution of Congress No. 137,
and the rules of procedure adopted by the Commission in accordance with the
Executive order and the joint resolution of Congress, I have been authorized
to take a sworn deposition from you.</p>

<p>I state to you now that the general nature of the Commission’s inquiry is to
ascertain, evaluate, and report upon the facts relating to the assassination of
President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.
In particular as to you, Mr. Slaughter, the nature of the inquiry tonight is to
determine what facts you know about the death of Oswald and any other pertinent
facts you may know about the general inquiry, and particularly what you
may know about Jack Ruby and his whereabouts and movements on Sunday,
November 24.</p>

<p>Mr. Slaughter, normally the witnesses are required to come before the Commission
by a written letter or notice in writing sent to them by a member of
the Commission or the general counsel, Mr. J. Lee Rankin. I have such a letter
in my possession, but we have been unable to get it to you on account of your
work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. I have the letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you get it over 3 days ago?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. I got it; I got it last Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, that’s fine. Then, it is over 3 days ago. Now, would you
stand and take the oath, please? Do you solemnly swear the testimony you
are about to give before the Commission will be the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you state your name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Malcolm R. Slaughter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Forty-four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your residence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. 5638 Ridgeway Drive, Houston, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation, Mr. Slaughter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Line driver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. For what company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. For Red Ball Motor Freight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been so employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Eight years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are a family man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you have a wife and children?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand that tonight you are en route from one point to
another?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think that during last fall you and at least one other of your
friends or fellow drivers of trucks rented an apartment as a stopoff or sleeping
place here in Dallas; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. We were domiciled in Dallas at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you tell us where this apartment was located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. In the Oak Cliff section of Dallas—223 South Ewing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What apartment did you have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Apartment 204.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who else shared that apartment with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Jack Scritchfield [spelling] S-c-r-i-t-c-h-f-i-e-l-d, and Sidney
Evans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t have that apartment any more, I take it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. No, sir; I vacated March 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you first occupy the apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. October 30, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how often were you there between that date and November
24, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. You say—how often?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, sir—I mean—did you live there or were you on the road a
great deal of the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. We maintained our homes in Houston but due to the fact we
drove out of Dallas, Tex., off of the pool board in Dallas, we had to maintain
a residence in Dallas. That’s why the three of us split costs and rented this
apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I wanted to get at—we are talking about a period of
approximately 24 or 25 days, from October 31, I think you said, until November
24, and I was just wondering how many of those nights or days you were
on the road and didn’t occupy the apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Well, I have logs to substantiate it—I can’t give you the exact
figure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No, sir—just approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. In and out—every time I was in Dallas I stayed there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That would be how often, roughly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. It could be every night—every third night, and most generally
always on weekends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And when you did stay in that apartment it would be during
the daytime, sometimes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Yes, sir—mostly in the daytime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And mostly on Sundays and Saturdays?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. On weekends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On weekends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever get to meet a man by the name of Jack Ruby who
occupied an apartment in that same building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Not personally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him prior to November 24, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. I would say possibly two or three times in passing, only.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever converse with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. No, sir; only to say “hello” or some such greeting as that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know his name at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. No, sir—not at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Prior to November 24 you did not know his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know George Senator, who lived with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know him as well as you knew Jack Ruby, say, but of
course—you didn’t know him at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. I don’t know George Senator to this moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know a man, even if you did not know his name, who
shared an apartment with Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, coming precisely to November 24, 1963, do you remember
whether you were at the apartment that you have described on that date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember whether you saw Jack Ruby on that date? At
or about or near the apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. On November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At approximately what time did you see him, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Approximately 10:05 a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you are fixing that time very accurately, and I want to
ask you how you do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Mr. Evans had just returned from a Catholic church in Oak
Cliff, stating that he thought there was a 10 o’clock mass; however, there was
none, so he returned to our apartment approximately at 10 o’clock a.m. I had
just gotten up when he came in the apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s Evans you are talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. When Evans came in the apartment, I spoke to him and asked
him what happened. He replied there was no mass at 10 a.m. He had decided
to go to 11 o’clock mass. I went out in the kitchen and put on the coffee pot.
Then I asked Evans how was the weather? He said, “Rather windy.” So, as
was my custom, I walked out on the balcony just for my own information to
see what the weather was like. It is approximately 50 feet to the railing
where I would look down the freeway, and as I walked out the door toward this
railing, I met Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that in the hallway of the place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. On a balcony, sir. He was coming the opposite way. I said,
“Good morning,” and he acknowledged the greeting, not with the words “Good
morning,” or “Howdy,” or any such statement, but he did acknowledge the
greeting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, he made no sound but he made a nod, I suppose;
is that what you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. “Hmmm”; something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You passed right by him, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Within a matter of a foot or two?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How was he dressed at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. In my terms, I would say very casual, such as a pair of
khakis and a light jacket. I, myself, wear khakis and T-shirt as lounging
clothes, we’ll use that term. I would say that Jack Ruby was dressed similarly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have a coat on, and I don’t mean an overcoat, but a coat
to a suit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have a shirt or tie on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. I don’t think he did. As I said, he did have a light jacket
on and it appeared to be as my dress or a T-shirt, or some nature as that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he appear to be shaved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. I didn’t observe that closely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you observe whether his hair was disheveled?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. His hair was combed and I’ll say he was more or less looking
down as if in deep thought. That’s my impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have a hat on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From what direction was he coming?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Direction-wise he was coming from the end of the stairs
which would let him walk in front of our apartment on down to his. As for
direction, that would <span class="locked">be——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was going toward his apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If he continued in that direction, he, of course, could get to
his apartment, but could he get to the lower floor at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Not without back tracking or passing his apartment. There
is a stairway on either end of the balcony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you met him about the middle of it or something like
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Toward our end.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you observe whether he went into his apartment or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he carrying anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know where he parked his car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Only hearsay. There was parking space provided for all
tenants at the rear of the apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, considering where that parking space was, if he were
going from his car to his apartment, would he be taking the route you saw
him take, or would the other route have been better?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Well, as I say, I don’t know his car—I do not know where
he was parked. Presuming he would park where the rest of us did and he was
coming from his car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Presumably, it would have been the other end of the stairway
that he would have used.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Rather than what he probably used—that’s the stairway that
was on the end toward which you were approaching, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. That’s correct. My presumption there would be that he
had either been to the mailbox or to the manager’s apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could he have been to the basement where it was possible to
wash clothes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. That’s on the other end of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, that it would be improbable that he would be coming at that
time from the basement area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. It would be improbable—yes.</p>

<p>Air. Hubert. When Mr. Evans came in, were you awake?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. I know not whether I was awake or he awakened me upon
entering.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you would judge that it would be about 10 minutes from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
time that you first spoke to Evans until you saw Jack Ruby, or longer? Or
shorter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. I would say approximately that length of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About 10 minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. About 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, in order to get it exactly straight, you would
estimate that Evans came in about 5 minutes to 10, and that you occupied
yourself in speaking to him a bit, and putting on the coffee, talking about the
weather, and subsequently going out on the balcony and at the point at which
you saw Ruby 10 minutes had elapsed from the time you first had spoken to
Evans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. That’s approximately correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see Ruby any more that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there much space between your apartment and his apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Two apartments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You couldn’t hear anything that might be going on in his
apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear anything from the direction of his apartment
which might have indicated someone was leaving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear or see his automobile leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. No, sir; I haven’t seen him yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This third gentleman who shared the apartments with you, I
think you called him Mr. Scritchfield?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Jack Scritchfield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he there then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he see Ruby to your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Not on that day; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he sleeping?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. He had just gone to bed within 30 minutes of Evans’ arrival.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you would judge that he was asleep or at least in bed at
the time Evans got back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had he been up prior to that time and moving around?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. You are speaking of Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. He had just come in off of a run.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He walked right into the house and undressed and went to bed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. In a very short matter of time—I don’t know exactly what
time Jack got to the apartment, but he had been on an overnight run and he
had just arrived and was due to sleep all day Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Prior to the time that you saw Ruby, had Sidney Evans mentioned
anything to you about having seen him also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Not until after the television program.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you ever seen Ruby in or about the apartments with any
feminine company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you ever seen him there walking in or about with any man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you ever seen him with a dog?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Slaughter, have you ever been interviewed by any member
of the Commission prior to this occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. Not the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir, have you anything else that you can tell us
regarding the movements of Jack Ruby on this day or on any other day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you very much. We appreciate your cooperation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. That’s all right—I hope this was some help.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you again.</p>

<h2 id="SMART">TESTIMONY OF VERNON S. SMART</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of Vernon S. Smart was taken at 12:15 p.m., on March 25,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Burt W. Griffin, assistant counsel of the
President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Lieutenant Smart, my name is Burt Griffin, and I am one of the
attorneys on the advisory staff of the General Counsel of the President’s
Commission Investigating the Assassination of President Kennedy. This Commission
has been set up by virtue of an Executive order issued by President Johnson
and joint resolution of Congress. The Executive order is No. 11130 and the
congressional resolution is No. 137. We have promulgated a set of rules of
procedure, the Commission has, and under these rules of procedure, I have
been given authority to take your sworn deposition. Part of our rules of
standard procedure is to explain to you in advance what the general nature
of the Commission’s inquiry is. I will state in a general fashion that we
are trying to ascertain and evaluate and report back to the President on the
facts, and all of the facts, that relate to the assassination of President Kennedy
and the murder of Lee Oswald. Our particular concern in calling you has more
to do with the assassination or murder of Lee Oswald than it has to do with
the assassination of the President; however, we want to have all of the information
that you have which you think is pertinent to the matter that the Commission
is involved in. Now, we have addressed a letter, that is, the General Counsel
has addressed a letter, to Chief Curry requesting that you be made available to
appear here. Under the rules of the Commission, you are entitled to a personal
3-day notice before you testify. You can waive this notice. I will ask you
right now if you want the 3-day notice or whether you are willing to waive the
notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No; I will waive it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Also, you are entitled to have an attorney here, and some of
the witnesses do have attorneys and others of them don’t, and I take it that, by
the fact that you are appearing here alone, that you do not desire an attorney;
however, if you do desire to have an attorney present representing you, I wish
you would say so at this time, and don’t feel that it would be any embarrassment
to any of us or we would be concerned about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No; I don’t feel like I need one right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, let me tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Not for this; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We have no authority to prosecute anybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This is a factfinding matter, and I think more than very many
people fully appreciate that this investigation is intimately connected with the
security of the country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And, of course, most particularly the security of the President,
and it is terribly important from a standpoint of protection and making sure
that things don’t happen in the <span class="locked">future——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That we get everything. We have collected a lot of information
in this area, and I can only tell you that what you think might be unimportant
or would be more interested in withholding for fear of embarrassing somebody
could be terribly important to us when all of the pieces are put together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, let me ask you if you have any questions about what we
are doing here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No; I think I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me swear you in, then. If you will, will you raise your right
hand? Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give is the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Lieutenant Smart, when were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. July 10, 1912.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And where do you live now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is your address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. 2120 Ballycastle Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. And you are employed with the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you are a lieutenant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been with the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Twenty-nine years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you been interviewed by any member of this staff? I am
not talking about FBI agents, but any members of the President’s Commission
<span class="locked">staff——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Other than me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And have I interviewed you before taking your deposition here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. I am going to mark here for identification purposes
a copy of an interview that was held with you by Special Agents Bookhout and
Myers, [spelling] M-y-e-r-s, and that is Bookhout [spelling], B-o-o-k-h-o-u-t, of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation on November 25, 1963. I am going to mark
that, “Dallas, Texas, Lieutenant Smart, 3-25-64, Exhibit 5021.” I am going
to hand it to you and ask you if you have had a chance to read that over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, are there any additions or corrections that you would care
to make in that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No. I told it to them just as I saw and heard it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you file a report of your own activities with the police
department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I wonder if you would be good enough to provide us with a copy
of that. You think, after this interview is over, you could get a copy of it and
provide it to us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Could I?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. You say could I?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I think so. I don’t have it in my possession.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We have asked everybody else, and there is no problem on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Yes, I am sure they will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you this. Were you on duty on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where were you stationed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Wait a minute. November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The day that the President was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you on duty on November 23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what time did you come to work that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. 7 a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you are in charge of the auto theft division, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there any officer who is above you in the auto theft division?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. At that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No. You say are there or was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what was the relationship of Captain Nichols?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. He was off duty that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. But he is also an officer in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. He is in charge of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He <span class="locked">is——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. He is the captain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He is in charge of the whole division?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. The whole bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. In his absence, I am in charge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Now, what time did you leave on the 23d, leave work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. It was late in the afternoon. I don’t remember the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On the 23d, did you give any assistance in connection with the
investigation of the murder of the President, did you lend any assistance to
<span class="locked">that——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. To that investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you lend any assistance in connection with preserving
security in the building or press relations or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you tell us—I am talking about the 23d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Twenty-third?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you tell us what you did on the 23d in that regard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I was told by Chief Stevenson to have all of the men in my bureau
to stand by to assist in the transfer of Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when were you told this by Chief Stevenson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. It must have been—I can’t say for sure—in the neighborhood of
8 or 9 o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On Saturday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is the day before the transfer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Said he didn’t know what time they were going to move him
but to have all of the men stand by available.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you then pass the word throughout your division?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you prepare any written memorandum of this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would there be anything in writing to indicate what sort of
instructions were given or that there were instructions given?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. All verbal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember talking with any particular men about this
in your department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I talked to each one of them, told them to stand by and I would
tell them when to report to the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Now, of course, nothing happened, he wasn’t moved that
day, Oswald was not moved on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Wait a minute. I am all crossed up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I thought you were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I am talking about the day he was moved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I am all crossed up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. That is why I asked you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Sunday, wasn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is why I asked you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I am speaking of Sunday, the day they moved him, now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Saturday, I didn’t do anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, before you came to work on Sunday, had you heard anything,
even by way of rumor, with respect to the fact that Oswald might be
moved that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. That was when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Came to work—before you arrived at work on Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir; I didn’t hear anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, where was Stevenson when he talked to you
about having your men ready?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. In his office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And were you personally there or did you receive this by telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I received it from him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you have any discussion with him at that <span class="locked">time——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About the moving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir; he said have the men stand by and he would notify me
when to have them report to the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About how long was this before Oswald was actually moved,
would you estimate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I couldn’t say for sure, but I think I must have talked to him
between—it must have been around 9 o’clock in the morning or maybe earlier.
I am not sure. I didn’t make a note of the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And were there other department heads or bureau heads in
there at the time that you got this information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. In and out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have any information as to whether Stevenson made a
general request to all bureaus to have their men stand by or was this just
specifically directed toward you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I think it was general.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is, do you have any confirmation of that, have you talked
to other bureau heads, for example, to find out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Captain Jones.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What bureau is he connected with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Forgery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What about the other bureau heads there? Did you talk to
them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Captain Martin, we discussed it among ourselves about having
our men stand by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when did you discuss it with those gentlemen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Shortly after I talked with Stevenson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. It was general knowledge around that all of the men were supposed
to stand by. You know how those things get out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. I see. Now, when was the next time that you got any
information about the movement of Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. In the neighborhood of 11 o’clock, it could have been before or
after a little bit, Chief Stevenson told me to have my men report to the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what did you do when you took your men down to the
basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I instructed the men to go down to the basement and I went with
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you personally place these <span class="locked">men——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In any positions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember <span class="locked">if——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I turned them over to Captain Jones, he was handling that, and I
told him, if I could help him, to let me know, that I would be down there, and he
placed them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do at that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. At that time, they were attempting to back this armored truck in,
and I walked up the ramp, and they were having difficulty getting it in on
account of the height of it and so forth, and Chief Batchelor was present, if I
am not mistaken, he went down with us or in the group, and he and I decided
with the driver that we couldn’t get it all of the way down, and parked it about
a third of the way down, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you a uniformed officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Beg your pardon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you wear a uniform?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to get here a diagram that we have been using. I am
going to ask you to mark on this diagram. This is a diagram of the basement.
Here is the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The ramp up to Commerce Street, the ramp down from Main
Street, and the garage area. Now, can you mark on this map or <span class="locked">chart——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. This ramp goes on out like this, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. This is really a solid wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me explain what this is here. This is the basement wall,
this far black line is the basement wall, which underneath the ground goes all of
the way out to the sidewalk, beyond the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. However, at the street <span class="locked">level——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. This would all be sidewalk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This would all be sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, will you show us on this diagram where you were standing
just before Lee Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Well, I would say about here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you mark it with an “X” if you would?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. All right. Roughly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you do something? Would you put your initials beside
it or something to indicate that that is you? Okay. Now, did you see Sam Pierce’s
car go out of the driveway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No; I didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Which direction or what were you doing at the time that Pierce’s
car would have gone out about a minute ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I don’t know when his car went out. I heard them talking about it.
It was supposed to have gone out this way, wasn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; now, when you were standing by the armored car, were
you looking up to Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. At the time of the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; not at the time of the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Well, I was looking every way that I could, this side of the truck,
this side of the truck, trying to see down here from time to time, but I couldn’t
see much for the television lights.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, how <span class="locked">long——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I was mainly interested in the security angle from across the
street, so forth. That was my thought.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long had you remained—how long had you been here by
the side of this armored truck prior to the time that you heard any shots in
the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Oh, long enough that, when the truck backed down, Batchelor
and I found some bottles in it, anything that might be used as a weapon that was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
loose in the truck. I don’t know how long that would have been, practically
all of the time that I was in the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you standing beside the truck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No; I was up here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you want to mark up there where the truck was? Why
don’t you mark a square where the truck was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. This is strictly guesswork because I didn’t measure in feet or
anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This is all right. Just a rough idea. And you were standing at
the place where you were standing beside the truck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I had been in the truck, around the truck, I had taken some bottles
over here and set them on a ledge out of the way and I had walked back—of
course, this doesn’t represent too many feet—approximately halfway from the
truck down to the end of the ramp, and at the time that I heard the shot, I was
looking out this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. What did you do at the time that you heard the shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. What did I do at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I immediately rushed down to where the scuffle was going on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you at any time go into the jail office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I understand that you talked to “Blackie” Harrison right after
the scuffle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Yes, uh-huh, as soon as I got to the scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Ruby still there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Yes; I asked “Blackie” who he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk with “Blackie” after that that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Later in the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I don’t recall it if I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Between the time that you talked with Harrison and the time
that you were informed that you should go to Ruby’s car and search the car,
what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I was told by Chief Stevenson to check all of—to put guards on
the elevators and on the doors on the first floor.</p>

<p>(Discussion off of the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I did that, and I went back to my office, resumed my usual routine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is on the third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain up there on the third floor before you
were asked to do something in connection with Ruby’s car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I couldn’t say for sure. It was some time, though, elapsed, quite
some time elapsed, and Chief Stevenson would call me on the phone and gave
me the license number of his car and told me where it was parked, asked me—told
me there was a sum of money in it, to go over and remove it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You got out there, and I take it from your statement that you
found that somebody else had already been to the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You were the first one to the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I don’t think I said that anyone else had been to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I will correct the record, because his statement doesn’t reflect it,
what I said. All right. When you got to the car, was the car locked or
unlocked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. The doors were unlocked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you have a key to the car at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you been told at that time whether or not there was a key
to the <span class="locked">car——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or whether you needed one?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir; I hadn’t been told. I just assumed that the keys were
in the car, but nobody told me that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you got <span class="locked">there——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Being on a parking lot, you know, naturally, I didn’t think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there a dog in that car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was the dog when you got to the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. The dog had crawled under a newspaper in the front seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what did you do with the dog when you got in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. We had the squad come by and get it and take it to the animal
shelter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there anybody else that accompanied you out to that
automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Lieutenant Swain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And that is all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Well, we called the uniformed squad there a little bit later and
had the car put in the pound. It seems to me like there was one more detective.
I don’t remember. I believe it was Detective Watson. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was the first thing you searched?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. The glove compartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And I understand that you found his wallet in the glove compartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And a key to fit the trunk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you ever find out whether Ruby had a wallet on his
person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir; I never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever make any inquiry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you talk with Ruby about any of the equipment which
you found in the automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About the property which you found in the automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Lieutenant Swain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir; not in my presence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or that you know of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In the normal procedure, who would be the person who would
question him about that property?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Well, I would think it would be Captain Fritz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Did you examine this billfold?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you tell us what you recall being in that billfold?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. His driver’s license and several cards of identification like you
would normally carry in a billfold, but I don’t remember each one, what they
were or anything. Different cards with his name on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Social security card?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I believe his social security card was there. I am not sure. There
was just stuff—cards and papers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Do you think you would be able to identify that wallet
and contents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember anything else in there besides identification
cards in the wallet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there any money in the wallet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what else did you find in the glove compartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. A key.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. A single key?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. A single key.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this—where was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Just laying in the floor of the glove compartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it under some papers or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir; wasn’t much stuff in the glove compartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there anything else in the glove compartment besides the
key and the wallet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I remember looking, but I remember there was nothing of importance
that would have any bearing on anything. There was something there,
not much, though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was the key on top and exposed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No. The billfold was on top and the key was laying over on the
side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Just a lone key, a General Motors key.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Did it appear there had been any effort to conceal it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, after you searched the glove compartment, what did you
do? What did you search after the glove compartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Well, I sat down in the front seat to try this key, and I put my
hand down on these papers, and that is when I felt the dog. The dog raised
up. It didn’t fit the ignition keys, I mean the ignition switch, so I knew it
was a General Motors key, and I owned an Oldsmobile, and it looked like it
might be a trunk key, and I tried it, and it worked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, up to this point, you hadn’t searched the interior of the
car, nothing but the glove compartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir; nothing but just look over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you took this key, you were able to open the trunk,
weren’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you see when you opened that trunk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Well, some paper bags and some bank sacks, maybe one bank
sack, and just full of junk, almost full of junk, except there was a set of keys
laying right down in the open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, was this a set of keys?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Well, it was a bunch of keys.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were they on a ring?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. A ring or something to hold them together; I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many keys would you say were on this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Oh, roughly four or five.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, were there any keys that looked like they might be keys to
a house or door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how many keys on there appeared that they would be automobile
keys?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I don’t remember now. I can tell that the other key, you know,
they were shaped a little different, one of them was the ignition key, and I tried
it, and it worked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, if you were to see these keys, do you think that you would
recognize them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Yes, sir; I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you see the keys in the car, in the trunk of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Laying right in the floorboard of the trunk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Near the front?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Near the front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Exposed to view?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where were they in relationship to the paper sacks and the
money bags?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. To the right. The paper bags were more in the back. He had
two or three boxes of pictures of girls, and things like that, that we just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
thumbed through, maybe stacks of them that high, a lot of cards to his club.
That was mostly what the stuff was in the trunk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, if these keys were placed where you found them and one
had been driving that car, would the motion—were they placed in such a way
that the motion of the car or bumps and whatnot would move these about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I would think they would probably have scooted under papers
or something, would have been my guess, possibly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, is there anything that you saw or that you have learned
that would indicate to you how long those keys might have been in the back of
that trunk prior to the time that you opened it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. You want my thought?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. My thought, when I found things like they were, that Jack Ruby
had purposely put his billfold in the glove compartment and purposely put
his keys in the trunk compartment and locked it up and purposely left his
trunk key in the glove compartment so he could get to it. That was my thought.
I wondered why he left his billfold with all of his identification in it in his glove
compartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I would like to have your opinion as a trained investigator, anything
else that led you to believe this or why, other than simply the placement
that we have just discussed, that would have led you to think that he had
done what you mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Because, when he left the car on the lot, there was no attendant
there, I guess was the main reason. He parked it in an odd place and up on
an incline deal on the lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How was it an odd place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Well, the lot is kind of uneven, and it was pretty close out to
the center of the lot. It was where an old building had been torn down and
left some concrete in one place, you know, like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; would you—I am going to interrupt this just one second
here while I get this exhibit marked, and I am going to ask you, while I mark
this exhibit, would you draw on this piece of paper the intersection there, the
intersection of Commerce, Main and Pearl, and then would you draw the parking
lot where Ruby’s car was found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. These are two parking lots. They are all together but separately
operated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you put the two streets in there so we would know
which is Main and which is Pearl? Now, which is Commerce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. This is south.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, now. Let me ask you. Start over again here on
another sheet of paper. I want to get more detail on here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Oh, I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It would probably he easiest if you would draw the block,
Commerce, Harwood, Pearl and Main, and indicate the location of the police
department, the Western Union office and the parking lots on the corner of
Main and Pearl, and then show us which parking lot Jack’s car was in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I am not a very good artist, now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is okay. Is that the parking lot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Roughly about there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, we will go on the record. Now, you have
drawn a diagram here, which I am going to mark, “Dallas, Texas, Lieutenant
Smart, 3-25-64, Exhibit 5023,” and that appears to be a diagram of the intersection
of Main and Pearl with the Western Union marked and parking lot
designated on the northwest corner of Main and Pearl and an automobile marked
out there. Is that pencil mark of an automobile your best estimate of where
you found Ruby’s car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. That is approximately about where the car was parked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there any other cars in the parking lot at that time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. At that time, the parking lot had opened officially; there were
a few more cars; I don’t recall where they were—and an attendant there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Were there any other cars parked next to Ruby’s car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Other than—did you mention the location of these keys and
the billfold to anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who did you mention that to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Homicide detectives.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember any particular one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. There was two of them. I think it was Montgomery and his
partner. I am not sure. There is some new men in there that I don’t know
too well. We brought all of that stuff in there, showed Captain Fritz what
we had. He said, “Turn it over to them.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you write any report in connection with this search to the
police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So there is no written report in the police department of what
you just told me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would it be customary for anybody in the police department
to have written a report of what you told them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. It could be. I gave all of my information to the homicide boys,
because they were handling the case, turned the money over to them, the
keys, and turned everything over to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you do this favor to me? Inquire of Captain Fritz,
inquire and find out, if there is a report of what you told them, and, if so, give
us a copy of it so we could have it for our file?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you also find in the automobile some radio scripts
or something that had to do—well, do you recall finding anything that appeared
to be radio scripts or political propaganda materials?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir; I tell you, Mr. Griffin. I was instructed to go over
there and get the money—it seemed like that is what he was worried about,
his money—and bring it over and put it in the property room or have it put
into the property room, and when I ran into the billfold and the keys, I thought
they should be over there, too, and I told the homicide officers they should go
back and make a thorough check of the trunk and also that there might be
some pertinent information that they wanted, and I understood that they did.
What they found, now, I don’t know. I think that the FBI went, too, but I
never did go back and search anything else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So you removed the billfold and the keys and the money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Yes, sir; and a sack of miscellaneous stuff and the papers that
were in the front seat pertaining to the assassination. I thought that might
have some bearing. He had about four or five <span class="locked">current——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Newspapers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. With the spreads on the front, newspapers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did they appear to be complete copies of a newspaper or were
articles cut out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Complete <span class="locked">copies——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you <span class="locked">remember——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Which they were placed in the property room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see; now, did you file an inventory on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who did you turn that property over to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. To these two homicide officers. All I did was count the money
and initial it, so I would know myself, Swain and I did, so that we would be
protected on the amount of money. I understand that they listed all of the
stuff and inventoried it and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you testify at the Ruby trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have any personal knowledge that Captain Fritz actually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
became aware of how you had found this billfold and the location of
the keys?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Do I know what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know whether Captain Fritz ever actually became aware
of where you had actually found the keys and the billfold?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. We carried the stuff to his office and Swain told him that we
had the money and his billfold and some things taken out of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I heard him tell Captain Fritz that; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So it is <span class="locked">possible——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. So he told these two fellows to take over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So, if there were no actual written report of this ever <span class="locked">made——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. If there is, I imagine Montgomery—I believe it is Montgomery—I
could be mistaken—but it is those two guys. I could find out their names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay, okay; all right; did you talk with Ruby at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you got back to the homicide office, saw Fritz, had
Fritz talked with Ruby by then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I couldn’t tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you got back to the homicide office, had you been told
by anybody how Ruby got into the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or did you hear any rumor about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Oh, I heard rumors; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you—when was the first time that you heard that Ruby
had told somebody how he got into the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I am not sure where I heard it, but I heard it—some of the boys
talking, said that they heard that he said that he walked by some officers down
the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember <span class="locked">which——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. They were talking to Sam Pierce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; and do you remember which of the men you <span class="locked">heard——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Making this statement? How would they—would you have
heard this on the 24th, on the day that Ruby shot Oswald, or was it sometime
later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. I don’t remember, Mr. Griffin, now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You remember that there were a number of rumors that began
circulating right at the beginning, one that he came down the ramp, one that
he pushed a TV camera in, another one was that he used a press pass, another
one is that he got out of a police car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, had you heard, are you able to remember whether you
have heard, any or all of these rumors on Sunday when you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir; I can’t. I just heard them somewhere around there,
heard somebody—they weren’t talking even to me, I don’t think. Just discussing
it or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me take this off of the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off of the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let’s go on the record here. I am also going to mark for identification
as Exhibit 5024 a letter that you wrote to Chief Curry on November 27
with respect to what you heard down there in the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to mark it, “Dallas, Tex., Lieutenant Smart, 3-25-64,
Exhibit 5024.” Now, I want you to look at Exhibit 5021 and Exhibit 5024, and
will you tell me if you have read those over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Yes, sir; I have read those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you have already stated, I believe, as to each one of those
that there is nothing that you would add or subtract from that or correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. No, sir. If I knew something that would help you, I would tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you sign each of those in some place where it is conspicuous
and date it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Just the front sheet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is right, just the place where I have got it marked. Now,
would you also look at Exhibit 5022? That is the diagram of the basement.
You put some markings on that. Would you sign that? Would you also take
this Exhibit 5023, which you prepared? It is a diagram of the intersection
of Main and Pearl Expressway. Okay. I am much obliged, lieutenant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smart</span>. Okay, Mr. Griffin. I wish I could help you.</p>

<h2 id="SMITH">TESTIMONY OF JOHN ALLISON SMITH</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of John Allison Smith was taken at 2 p.m., on April 15, 1964,
at the Post Office Building, Fort Worth, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant
counsel of the President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. My name is Leon Hubert. I am a member of the advisory staff
of the General Counsel of the President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Under the provisions of President Johnson’s Executive Order 11130, dated
November 29, 1963, the Joint Resolution of Congress No. 137, and the rules of
procedure adopted by the Commission, in conformance with that Executive
order and that joint resolution, I have been authorized to take a sworn deposition
from you, Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>I state to you now that the general nature of the Commission’s inquiry is to
ascertain, evaluate, and report upon the facts relative to the assassination
of President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>In particular, as to you, Mr. Smith, the nature of the inquiry today is to
determine what facts you know about the death of Oswald, and any other
pertinent facts you may know about the general inquiry, and particularly as
to whether or not an individual by the name of Jack Ruby was seen by you
on Commerce Street near the Dallas Police Department Building on November
24, 1963.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Smith, I think that you are appearing here today as a result of a
letter addressed to you from Mr. J. Lee Rankin, the General Counsel for the Commission,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it true that that letter was received by you more than 3 days
ago from today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. It was received last Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And today, of course, is Wednesday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, do you mind taking the oath?
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. State your name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. John Allison Smith.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old are you, Mr. Smith?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. This being 1964, I am 42 at present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you reside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. 22 Shadowbrook Lane in Hurst, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. H-u-r-s-t?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I am classified as a TV technician.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have the same occupation on November 22, 23, and 24,
1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been employed by WBAP-TV?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Since November the 22d, 1945.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now were you on duty in your occupation in Dallas on November
23 and November 24, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you with the remote truck owned and operated by WBAP?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who else was with you in the operations during those days?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Well, there was quite a large crew. The way we are situated,
there is a basic crew that stays in the truck. That is “in person,” that has
to do with the picture, and one has to do with the sound, and that other person
that is connected with the sound is Mr. Walker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Ira Walker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes. In this particular case, ordinarily there is no cameraman
near the structure because they are usually in the premises, but in this case we
had a camera on top of the truck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was manning that camera on November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. That was Mr. Richey.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is Warren Richey?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now those two gentlemen came down here with you today
and are outside in the anteroom, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your duty during those days?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Well, call it “riding gain on the video.” What it amounts to is,
to adjust the picture information, using an oscilloscope and that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does that require that you be inside of the truck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Generally. You make short trips outside the truck. The one
case that has to do with this particular thing, the man that is responsible
for the video has to deal with the telephone company as to the class of picture
that you are sending out and so on. It was during one of these particular
trips away from the truck to contact the telephone company that I first saw
this person that I believe to be the same man as Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us what time that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Now here the times are going to have to be fairly accurate.
As far as minutes and seconds, we don’t watch things that closely, but the first
time I saw this person has to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 8:15 a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now there must be some reason why you fix that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. We went to work at 7, and it takes approximately an hour to turn
everything on and get it all warmed up to proper operation. Then we go
through this thing of what we call “lineup procedure,” on all the cameras,
which we had done. So for that reason, I placed this time at approximately an
hour after 7 a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But when all that procedure is done, did you leave the truck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Not yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. We had adjusted all these pictures, and in this particular instance,
there were only two. We called the telephone company and they looked at our
signal, and if they have any complaints or questions about the quality of the
picture, they would tell you what it was. There was a complaint about the
picture that I didn’t agree with, so we generally get together and one of us looks
at the other picture and talk it over and see what the thing amounts to. So I
had gone around to the telephone company. It is a mobile home little trailer
set up where they put the microwave equipment. Now this was on the west
side of the city hall building there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What street was it on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Well, what street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your truck was on Commerce Street, wasn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes. We were facing east.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is a one-way street going east, and you were facing east?
You were on the left-hand side of that street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes. And this trailer was around on the west side of this building
in the middle of the block.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, it was on the street which the back of your
trucked faced?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To go from your truck to that little vehicle you are talking
about, you would have to turn left off of your truck, walk down to the corner
and then turn right toward Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now let me suggest to you that that street is called Harwood
Street, and if you will keep that in mind, we can refer to it as Harwood Street.
I think it will make it simpler from now on. How far on Harwood Street from
the corner of Commerce was that little vehicle of the telephone company
parked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I would estimate it would be almost exactly halfway up the block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember seeing an entrance to the building around
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. It is right in front of the main entrance, the west side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The telephone company truck was right in front of the main
entrance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it on the same side of the street as the main entrance or the
opposite side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Same side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you walked up to that truck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you figure that because of all you have told us, that considering
the hour that it would have taken to warm up, considering that you
came and started off at approximately 7 and then you got the complaints and you
walked over, it must have been in the neighborhood of 8:15?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see this man that we are talking about, or will in a
moment, on the way to the telephone vehicle, or on the way back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. It was on the way back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you stay at the telephone truck then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. It was several minutes. We had to hook up a scope and he made
some adjustments there. I think I would say I was at the truck at least 10
minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then you walked back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. These are guesses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You walked back to your truck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you first see this individual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. When I got around the corner and almost back to our truck,
this person was standing there on the sidewalk almost parallel with our truck.
That is in the vicinity of the door of the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The door of the city hall, or of the police department building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Building. I refer to it as the city hall. What is the name
of that officially?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There are two. Actually one is the city hall or the police
department opening which is on the Harwood Street side of the automobile
exit. The building on the other side of the Commerce Street exit from where
your truck was is the municipal building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. It wasn’t the municipal building. We didn’t go there until later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So he was standing about at the staircase entrance to the Dallas
Police Department Building on the sidewalk between the building and your
truck, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How close did you get to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Probably 30 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, where was he standing, or what was he doing, rather?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. He was standing there looking up at the windows where we had
some cables running through. You see, we had camera gear up on this floor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
where all the interrogation was taking place and all, and this person was
just standing there looking at the cables and inquisitive, maybe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there a crowd of people around there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir; not at this time of day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How was he dressed, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Now here this probably conflicts with anything you heard, but
I am talking about a particular person, and one that I saw had on a light
grey topcoat and a light grey hat, shabby appearance, not neat, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you notice whether he had a tie on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir. I was looking at him from a quarter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you get a full view of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir; not at this time. It is the type of person that we see often
when we go out on an early morning remote. It is the person that is walking
the street with no place to go. That is what he impressed me as being. And
it kind of fit in that he was just standing looking up at these cables and doing
nothing more than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you observe him do anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Not at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear him say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see that same person later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes. Now here this is probably a more inaccurate guess than
the other as to time, but it was later in the morning. At least an hour or
maybe an hour and a half later than that. We were at a break and I was
sitting in the back of the truck, and to the best of my knowledge, Walker
was in there, but it was during the time when you are not rehearsing and you
are not on a standby condition. You are relaxed and you are not familiar
with this old truck, but I will try to picture to you that it is an enclosed thing.
It is kept rather dark for the picture’s sake, and it gets warm in there. And
sometime I will open these curtains or turn on the fan and get a little ventilation.
This happens even in the wintertime. And I lowered the curtain on my
side and there stood this same man there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There can be no doubt in your mind that that was the same
man you had seen earlier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. That’s right. Now this is the same particular person that I
am talking about. They are one and the same. Same coat and same hat and
same everything. And when I opened the curtain, this man is no less than 2
feet from the truck here, and he is standing there very nonchalantly, you
know, and he says, “Have they brought Oswald down yet?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there a glass window between you and this man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. It wasn’t pulled to. It was open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. It is a sliding, double-sliding window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then you had a full-face view of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that you were not in excess of 3 feet from him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your face and his face were not separated by more than 3 feet
at that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You heard him say, “Have they brought down Oswald yet?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. “Have they brought Oswald down?” Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did anyone answer him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I did. I don’t know how to explain it. You see, my first reaction
was one of a joke, you know. Here we were all sitting around here for days
waiting for this news story to develop, and a man asks you have they brought
Oswald down yet, and to me I am thinking if they had brought him down and
taken him to the county building, why would we be here? And I started my
answer like, “What do you think?” And then he repeated his question again,
“Have they brought him down?” And he didn’t call his name the second time,
like it was understood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, he really asked twice? The first time he used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
Oswald’s name and the second time he referred to him by the use of the pronoun
“him,” and the second time you told him, “No”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I said, “No, sir; they haven’t brought him down, or we wouldn’t
still be sitting here.” And he just turned and walked away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him there after that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Now I think I did, and I am not sure. But this is the same man.
The third time was in a crowd, and I could tell you pretty well what time this
was, because KRLD put a camera in front of our truck at approximately 10 a.m.
That is another guess. But they had time to turn that camera on and get it
warm before all the news broke, so it had to be somewhere in the neighborhood of
10 or maybe before. But after that camera was set up, KRLD had a couple of
engineers out there lining up the camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was on Commerce Street with the camera facing down into
the Commerce Street ramp of the building, I take it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. They had this thing facing—you see, our truck wasn’t up to the
ramp. There was room for a car almost between our truck and the ramp. Now
they had this camera in that space right directly in front of our truck there, and
they had a man standing on the sidewalk lining up their camera.</p>

<p>And this TV camera, it always draws a crowd, and at this time there was
quite a few people just standing around. But this man that I am talking about,
I am almost certain, was standing on the other side of the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of the Commerce Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes; on the sidewalk, in a group of people, just standing there
watching the proceedings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall the time at which the police moved all of the people
from the police department side of Commerce Street over to the other side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No; I don’t. Someone asked me that before. I don’t remember
that taking place. You see, I was never told anything about the move. I was
inside the truck, so I didn’t have any connection with that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now when you saw this man, or think you did, possibly did, the
third time, had you come out of your truck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes; I had been down in the basement. We were running some
microphone cords, you see. I know this adds up to an awful long story how
we move around so much, and it doesn’t make sense to you, I am sure, but
sometime during the morning Chief of Police Curry had told us that we would
not be allowed to go through the double doors that separate the underground
parking area from the underground office area. It is a double door there
adjacent to the elevator opening, and he had told us that we would not be
allowed beyond that door for any reason, but that he would give us a good place
to put a camera and a microphone if we wouldn’t interfere with his passageway
from there on out to the parking lot.</p>

<p>So we had gotten permission to set this camera up right next to that door,
and we were the first camera in line there, and we were going to run two
microphones in there. That was the plan at that time, in case they should
allow an interview. We had hoped that they might, which later didn’t work,
but in the running of this microphone, this microphone went through the downstairs
door into the office area. They didn’t go down the ramp or anywhere
near the parking area, but in running the microphones and in helping the
Walker crew check out the mikes and all coming back to the truck is when I
had seen this man standing over there to the left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was to your left as you came out of the Commerce Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How close did you get to him then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. It was even further than before. It was all the way; well, the
length of our truck is 20 some odd feet, and it was a couple of car lengths more;
so I was 40 or 50 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean he was a couple of car lengths beyond the entrance, the
Commerce Street exit, rather?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Perhaps I misunderstood you. Did you see him immediately as
you came out of the Commerce Street ramp exit, or when you got back to the
truck?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Now I didn’t come up the ramp. I came up the steps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, I see. When you came up the steps, you went to the back of
the truck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So the distance between you and him was the length of the truck
plus the distance between the front of your truck to the ramp, plus the width of
the ramp and some distance beyond that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Making a total of, you think, roughly 40 feet or so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And there he was not alone, but with other people, you thought?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Standing in a crowd.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see that individual any more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir. Now you see it is hard for me to say that I could identify
that man if he were to walk in this room right now, because, as far as I am
concerned, I have only seen that face live one time. That is when he came to
the window. And seeing somebody in films and all, that is kind of hard to
associate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, did you know Jack Ruby at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now you have come, of course, to know the face and the man
called Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you see the face of Jack Ruby in person, live, face to face
as it were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Not since; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you associated the face that you have come to know as
Jack Ruby from photographs and pictures and so forth, with the man that we
have been talking about for the last few minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us how that came about, and when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. The closest that I ever made the association was when we were
shown a mug shot, and when I saw that mug shot, it was a straight-on photograph,
and it struck me as being the same face as the one in the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any spontaneous reaction in that regard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Well, I was convinced to myself that that was the same man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you make any observations to anyone to that effect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, but Walker did to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At that moment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. A couple of seconds later; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he looking at the mug shot, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. We were looking at the mug shot on a monitor in the truck. You
see, they took the mug shot out of the file upstairs in the City of Dallas Police
Department, brought the mug shots out into the corridor and told the TV people
they could take stills of it for their own use, and then they would take the mug
shot right back to the file, that no one could have it to copy or anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, in other words, you simply had the people on the third floor
put your camera unit on the mug shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then it came through to your monitor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you at that moment associate the face that you saw on the
mug shots in the monitor with the man that you had seen earlier and which you
have described to us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there any suggestion to you by Walker, or did you reach
that opinion before he said anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I had noticed a distinct similarity. Now there is a difference in
that, when I saw him, he had on a hat, and that was the only reason that I
would not say positively that that is the same man. But there is the only
reservation that I have. But I had noticed on my own that there was a tremendous
similarity right through here [indicating].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When the witness said “through here,” he was placing one hand
at the level of his forehead and the other hand under his chin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. And a few minutes later, after this, Walker commented to me
that the person on that mug shot looked to him like the same one that had been
up to the truck a couple of times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had he told you prior to that that he had noticed this man come
to the truck a couple of times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Not prior to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that your observation of this man coming up to the truck a
couple of times was independent of that of Walker, and it had not been communicated
between you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you communicate your association between the mug shot of
Jack Ruby and the man you had seen, to Mr. Warren Richey?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Not at this time. Several days later we discussed it, and we
seemed to be of the same opinion at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have never seen Ruby in person since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir. Let me say this. The person that I am talking about
is, I hate to say, dirty, an unkempt person that possibly could have slept with
his clothes on, you see. He would be the opposite of what we see in these
photographs of a well-dressed, natty person with stylish clothes. I am talking
about the opposite type of person from that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now let me ask you this. Aside from your association of the
man on the street and the mug shot of Ruby, have you in your mind compared
your recollection of the man on the street with other photographs that you
have seen of Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No. I have never seen a photograph of Ruby that gives me that
same picture; you know what I mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, the answer is really that you have made the comparison,
but that you cannot feel as sure that the man on the street was the Jack Ruby
that you saw in subsequent pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At least as much as you feel that the man on the street was the
Jack Ruby you saw in the mug shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Right. Now I am drawing a comparison between the man in
the window and the mug shot. Those two struck me as being the same. The
pictures that I saw in film are not as familiar to me, you know. That is hard
to explain. I don’t guess it makes sense, does it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you venture to say that the man on the street whose
face came within 3 feet of yours and the man in the mug shot were, beyond any
reasonable doubt, the same person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. The only reason that I would have any doubt was this thing
of the hat. Now I couldn’t see his hairline and I couldn’t see the complete face.
With that thing in mind, I would not say that positively is the same man; I
can’t say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you did see the complete face when you were within 3
feet of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes. He had the hat on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the mug shot did not, I take it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With that reservation, you would have no doubt it is the same
person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Smith, I have in my hand a copy of a report of an interview
of you dated December 4, 1963, made by FBI Agents Haley and Madland which
I have marked for identification as follows: “Fort Worth, Tex., April 15, 1964,
Exhibit 5317, deposition of John A. Smith,” and I signed my name below it. I
would like you to read this, and after, I will ask you some questions about it.</p>

<p>(Mr. Smith reads report.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. This thing doesn’t refer to him asking the question twice, which
I believe I mentioned before, but essentially that is true.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At the time that you were interviewed by Mr. Haley and Mr.
Madland, were there other people present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Let’s see; Mr. Haley, I believe, was the one that came over by
himself. Then another—you see, I have been contacted three or four times,
and I am not the best on names. We were contacted by two people at one time,
and I believe they were from the city police department. I am not sure. I
can’t even remember when I met Mr. Davis. He was on one of those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall an interview that was had by FBI agents in the
studio at which Richey and Walker were present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, addressing yourself to that interview, was it conducted
individually or as a group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. When I first got there, he was talking to one of the others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He, or were there two people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Just one. There was one person conducting the interview, and
he was talking to—I am not sure—he was, I believe, talking to Jimmy Turner,
and I stayed there for several minutes. And this other interview was concluded.
Then I was interviewed separately, alone. Then Walker, I believe,
came in, and he talked to both of us for several minutes. Then we went out
to the garage where the truck is parked and he looked at the physical layout
of the truck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, did you ever have an individual interview with Haley
and Madland, the FBI men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes; I had an interview with one FBI man, individually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On the same day as the general?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No. This was prior to this day I am talking about, and I believe
that first man was Mr. Haley. I believe he was the first one there, and I am
not sure about the name. But the first FBI man that contacted me—us, talked
to us individually. At least he talked to me individually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever been interviewed by any member of the President’s
Commission staff prior to this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you anything else you want to add?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir; except to say that I hope that we make sense. When
all this happened, we weren’t paying any attention to time, faces, or anything
else. And I do hope that what we do kind of makes sense to you. I am afraid
it doesn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It does to me. Thank you very much, indeed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. This whole thing has been kind of a horrible experience, hasn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Glad you came over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. If we can help in any way, just call us.</p>

<h2 id="STRONG">TESTIMONY OF JESSE M. STRONG</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of Jesse M. Strong was taken at 12:35 p.m., on March 31, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the
President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of J. M. Strong [spelling] S-t-r-o-n-g.</p>

<p>Mr. Strong, my name is Leon Hubert. I’m a member of the advisory staff of
the General Counsel of the President’s Commission. Under the provisions of
Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, the Joint Resolution of
Congress No. 137, and rules of procedure adopted by the Commission in conformance
with that Executive order, I have been authorized to take a sworn
deposition from you. I state to you that the general nature of the Commission’s
inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate, and report upon the facts relating to the
assassination of President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee
Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
In particular to you, Mr. Strong, the nature of our inquiry is to determine
the facts you know about the death of Oswald and any other pertinent facts you
may know about the general inquiry, particularly in the field of the Western
Union telegram that is involved in this matter. Now, Mr. Strong, I understand
that you have appeared here today by virtue of a request made by a letter
addressed to you by J. Lee Rankin, General Counsel of the President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think that letter was received by you more than 3 days ago,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, would you stand so that you may take the oath.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you state your name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes. Jesse M. Strong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. 62.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your residence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. 612 Edgewood Terrace, Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Relief night manager at Western Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been connected with Western Union Co.
altogether?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Since January 1923.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Near 40 years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Over 40.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes, sir; 41, to be exact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you on duty with the Western Union Co. in Fort Worth
on November 24, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What office were you then located at?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. The Fort Worth office located at Main and Third, Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I invite your attention to a document which, for purposes
of identification, I am marking “Dallas, Tex., March 31, 1964. Exhibit 5121,
Deposition of J. E. Strong——”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. J. M.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. J. M. Strong [spelling] S-t-r-o-n-g.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am placing my name on that document also, and so that the
record may show that both of us are talking about the same document, I will
ask you to put your name below it. I am also marking another document,
“Dallas, Tex., March 31, 1964. Exhibit 5120, Deposition of J. M. Strong”
placing my name on that document and I ask you to place your name on it so
that the record may show that we are both speaking of the same document.
Now, I hand you the document that has been identified for the record as Exhibit
5121, and ask you to state what that document is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. It is a copy of the money order as received in Fort Worth
at 12:56 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On what date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. On November 24, 1963—1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. 1964?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. I’m sorry. Yes, certainly, payable to Karen Bennett sent by
Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have anything to do with that transaction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. I actually paid the $25 to Karen Bennett when she came into
the office, approximately at 3:20 p.m., on the afternoon of November 24.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In what way do you identify this document? Is there anything
on it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes, I asked her for identification and she presented her California
driver’s license No. 768114, and description, black hair, blue eyes, height
5 feet 2. Weight 105.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I notice that those figures that you have just read off appear
on the face of that document, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In whose handwriting are those figures written?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Mine. I wrote it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is the significance of a time stamp, apparently, reading as
follows: “1963, November 24th, p.m. 12:54.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. After Karen Bennett had signed the receipt for the money and I
handed her the $25, I put this under the time stamp and stamped the time the
transaction was completed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I think there you have reference to the other stamped time
as—reading as follows:</p>

<p>“1963, November 24th, p.m. 3:25”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, <span class="locked">I——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. I’m sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I asked you about the 12:54.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. I’m sorry, that is the time it was received in our traffic department
located on the third floor of the building at Third and Main.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How is that time stamped?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. By a time stamp the same as we have in all the offices.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that one of those timeclocks that the Western <span class="locked">Union——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To your knowledge, is that synchronized to national time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. I am not too certain of that, because they can be set rather easily
with a key, and they have—it is, I believe, an independent unit. Now, it might
be synchronized as a group, but I don’t believe with a master clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, are you sure of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. No, sir; I am not—I am not too positive of it, yet, it could be—very
well be tied into the master circuit and synchronized the same as the
clocks are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know of any clocks that are used in the Fort Worth office
that are not synchronized into the national circuit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. You are speaking of time stamps? No, no; they are all on the
same circuit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would it be your opinion that all the time stamps on this Exhibit
5121 were stamped by machines that are synchronized to the national circuit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes, sir; I believe that is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I think you have already testified that the other time
stamp on here, to wit: “3:25 p.m., November 24th,” indicates the time that the
money was actually delivered, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes, as soon as I had paid her the money I turned that immediately
and stamped that on the clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that the time of delivery of the money and time of stamping
are almost identical?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes, but a few seconds intervening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have an independent recollection of this transaction,
Mr. Strong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Nothing that was outstanding, sir, because as a party comes in
inquiring for money and they have the money order, there is a routine form,
almost has become routine, that we use to satisfy ourselves that the right party is
receiving the money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know whether the person made inquiry about this money
at any time prior to the time that the money was <span class="locked">actually——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. That is apparently true although I did not talk with her myself,
but in the lower right-hand corner you will find the letters, “WC”, which indicates
will-call. That was placed there by one of our telephone operators who
had answered her inquiry and gone to the file and searched this out and told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
her that it was there and that she had informed her that she would call at the
office for the money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you get this information from that telephone operator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. No; but it was on—it was given directly to me and I just recorded
it on the form.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that when this document came into your possession you knew
from the numerals, or letters, “WC”, that there would be a call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. That is the initial JMS, and California driver’s license—California—Calif—driver’s
license, BR, abbreviations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that the identification on the driver’s license?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I show you on Exhibit 5121, stamped on an angle right below the
word “Union,” in large letters what appears to be another stamp of time which is
not quite clear to me. It seems to say, 1963, November 24th, and then something
in parentheses, and 60 something. Can you tell us what that means?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes; the 26 in parentheses is the digit time that the operator
completed the transmission of the message in Dallas one day—-the filing time on
the application will show 12:26, that the time the operator completed sending
it. This 1:04 p.m. is the time that the money order actually reached the main
floor after the operator on the third floor released it. We stamp it again when
it comes down again from the operating room—the money order department, and
that was what the 1:04 p.m. means, actually received the money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is the parentheses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. I say, the digit number when the operator in Dallas completed
sending it. In other words, here the message was filed at 11:17 a.m., sent back
to the traffic department and the operator put her stamp on it, and when it is
completed then she puts the 2:06 in digits indicating that the transaction was
completed now, which would have been 11:26 I assume.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say that is when the telegram got back to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. That is when it left Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, it would not have left Dallas on November 26.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. No; this is the digited time.</p>

<p>In other words, either 11:26 a.m., or 12:26 p.m. indicating that the operator
had completed the transaction at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, I show you another document which has been
identified as Exhibit 5120, and ask you what this document represents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. On certain money orders when the party is coming into the office
to receive payment we make up what we call a receipt form. That, you will
notice, is a money order receipt form with my initials, J. M. S., and D. L. L., and
No. 4, the wire number out of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does this conform with the number on Exhibit No. 5121?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes, the same number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. And then, of course, the dates and the sender’s name, the office
from which the money order came. The date, the amount and the payee’s name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, who typed that out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On Exhibit 5120?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes, I typed all of this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I see a signature there which purports to be that of Karen
Bennett. Who <span class="locked">signed——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Karen Bennett supposedly is the one who came in and presented
the California driver’s license.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you are referring to the figures on Exhibit No. 5120, is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she sign that in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I think you have already testified that from the time stamp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
on Document 5121, she would have signed that at approximately 3:25 p.m., on
November 24, 1963, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. That’s correct, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is nothing on Exhibit 5120, that indicates the time of sending,
is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you able to state, however, that the time stamped on 5121,
indicates that the transaction was completed at 3:25 p.m., on November 24, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes, immediately after Karen Bennett signed this receipt I
<span class="locked">stamped——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. “This receipt,” to wit: Exhibit 5121?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Then I stamped the Exhibit 5121, to show the time that payment
had been made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that’s all you know about the matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes, sir; that’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember if Karen Bennett was alone or was there someone
with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. She was alone. There was no one with her that came into the
office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had she been waiting around?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. No, sir; no. She walked in and I immediately waited upon her.
Asked her if I might help her, and she told me she was expecting a money order,
and, of course, I went through the money order file and paid her upon her
identification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you prepared the money order receipt, which is identified as
Exhibit 5120, prior to the time she came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes, we do that as quickly as they come in, as we find the time
to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, we have been speaking about Exhibit 5120, in a sense that
might indicate we were dealing with the original document. I asked you if it
is not true that the actual piece of paper that we have identified as 5120, is a
photostatic copy of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes, it is. The original would be green in color.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see. There are some initials on 5120 following the words, “Issuing
employee.” Whose initials are those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Those are my initials indicating that I paid the money order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Strong, have you had any interviews with any members of
the President’s Commission other than myself in regard to this matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. No, I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, there was an interview between you and me prior to the
commencement of this deposition earlier this morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In this deposition, have we covered everything that was covered
in the course of our interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. I think so. I don’t believe there is anything I can add there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know of any inconsistencies in our interview that have
not been developed in the course of this deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This Karen Bennett came in in a normal manner and left in
a normal manner and exhibited no emotion whatsoever?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know of the shooting of Oswald when she came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. No, sir; I did not. I have been on duty since 7 o’clock that
morning with no means of communication whatsoever. In fact, I did not know
it until after payment of this money order had been made. One of the messengers
mentioned the fact that Oswald had been killed, and that a party by
the name of Rubenstein had shot him, which couldn’t register with me at all,
because I did not connect the names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Karen Bennett indicate in any way that she knew that Ruby
had shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. No, sir; there was no conversation between us at all other than
the conversation in respect to the money order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. Pardon me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Strong</span>. And the identification. After the transaction she left the office
and there was no occasion of that—there was no further conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you very much, sir.</p>

<h2 id="WALKER">TESTIMONY OF IRA N. WALKER, JR.</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of Ira N. Walker, Jr., was taken at 1 p.m., on April 15, 1964,
at the Post Office Building, Fort Worth, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr.,
assistant counsel of the President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Ira N. Walker, Jr.</p>

<p>Mr. Walker, my name is Leon Hubert. I am a member of the advisory
staff of the General Counsel of the President’s Commission on the Assassination
of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Under the provisions of President Johnson’s Executive Order 11130, dated
November 29, 1963, the Joint Resolution of Congress No. 137, and the rules of

and that joint resolution, I have been authorized to take a sworn deposition from
you, Mr. Walker.</p>

to ascertain, evaluate, and report upon the facts relative to the assassination
of President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>In particular as to you, Mr. Walker, the nature of the inquiry today is to
determine what facts you know about the death of Oswald and any other
pertinent facts you may know about the general inquiry, and particularly about
the whereabouts of Jack Ruby near the Police Department Building in Dallas
on November 24.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Walker, I believe you appeared here today by virtue of a request
made in writing to you by Mr. J. Lee Rankin, General Counsel of the President’s
Commission. For the record, would you state whether you received that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I did; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Must have been last Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was in excess of 3 days ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, so would you mind taking the oath?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give
will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you
God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you state your name, please, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Ira N. Walker, Jr.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your age, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Thirty-five.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. 6913 Hightower.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Broadcast technician.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. WBAP-TV.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been so employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Since 1948.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you on duty in Dallas in connection with the visit of the
President of the United States on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I was on duty after the assassination of the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you first go on duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. In Dallas, the afternoon of the shooting. We went to Parkland
Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say, “we,” who do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Our remote crew truck and crew of about four of five of us,
the first day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say a remote truck? Is that one of those trucks like a
Greyhound bus that you haul the equipment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. It is a little smaller than that, but it is the same.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What does your crew generally consist of? Or what did it
consist of during that period we are talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Well, the first day, that was a rush deal and there wasn’t but
four of us available, I think. And the second day, there was probably about
eight of us, I imagine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now the first day, you mean the first day after the President’s
assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes. Just after the assassination we took the truck with the
men available and went.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was on the 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So when you talk about the first day, you mean the day of
the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. The day of the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say you “took” and “went,” did you go from Fort
Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. From Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. We had already been to the President’s breakfast here in Fort
Worth, and I covered that for radio here in Fort Worth. There was a crew
with the TV truck here in Fort Worth, and they had already gone home at
the time the President was assassinated, and I was still on duty, and they
were called back in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, could you name for us the people who were on the remote
truck on the first day after the assassination of the President? That
is to say, November 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Well, let’s see, Johnny Smith and Warren Richey.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. And myself, and Dan Smith went that first day, I think. I don’t
think he went any more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now each of you all had a definite function to perform, of
course?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that we get it for the record and need not repeat it with
the other witnesses, tell us the functions of each one of you on the truck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I was to handle audio, Johnny Smith was the video engineer,
and the other two men were cameramen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. One of them drove the truck, I take it? Or did you have another
man to drive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes; Johnny Smith was driving the larger truck, and I was
in the little panel truck. And Supervisor Tom Bedford was driving the panel
truck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that on the first day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, let’s pass to the second day. That is to say, Saturday the
23d. And by way of orientation, let me state that by that time, of course, the
President was dead and Oswald had been charged both with the assassination
of Officer Tippit and President Kennedy, and was in custody at the Dallas
Police Department Building on Commerce, the building bounded by Commerce
and Main on two sides, and Harwood on the front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
Now, on that second day, the 23d, did you have occasion to be on duty with
the remote truck that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All day long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Well, we were called out of bed at 1 o’clock Saturday morning.
Let’s see, we burnt the engine up on the remote truck going to Parkland Hospital
the day before, and it had to be towed over there by a wrecker, and I don’t
know exactly what time we got to the Dallas City Hall. It was probably something
like 3 in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you park the truck, the remote truck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. On the south side. That would be on Commerce Street, I
believe. Right in front of the entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The Commerce Street entrance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How far away from the front, if you remember, roughly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Let’s see, there was, I believe, another remote truck between
our truck and the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say the corner of Commerce and Harwood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were closer to the Commerce Street entrance than that
truck was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes; we were directly in front of the Commerce Street stairway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The Commerce Street exit from the basement is just beyond
the Commerce Street stairway in the direction of Pearl Street, the Pearl
Expressway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So I suppose it is fair to say that the front of your truck was not
far from the Commerce Street exit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Well, the front of our truck was—there was just room enough
for a motorcycle to park between the front of our truck and the driveway
going to the basement of the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, you had cameras on the inside, I take it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And on the outside, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. And one on top of the truck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did the truck stay there all that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes; it stayed there all that day and that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the next day, the 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes; it was there all day the 24th up until, let’s see, I won’t
tell you—I want to tell you very much, but this is very hard. That was a lost
week for me. We slept very little, and most of the time I couldn’t even tell
you what day it was over there, so it is difficult to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s put it this way. To your knowledge, the truck never moved
from its position as you have described it on Commerce Street until after the
assassination of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you on duty continuously?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. The first day on Saturday, let’s see, we came in at—they woke
us up about a little after 1 in the morning, and I was there until, I know, after
10 that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Saturday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes, sir; I was going to bring that schedule with me and I
forgot. It was in last year’s book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then at what time did you go to work on Sunday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I don’t remember. It was early, but I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you say it was daylight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. It was right at daylight, I imagine. There was only one day
that we came in late, and I believe it was later on in the week. We were over
there early every morning except one, and we came in at 9 o’clock, that morning,
but I believe it was later on on Monday or Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know Jack Ruby or of his existence prior to, say, the
assassination of the President?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you first see a man that you now know to be Jack
Ruby, if you did see such a man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I did see him, and I would say it was sometime after 10:30
in the morning that Oswald was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, of the 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Let’s see; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now you didn’t know him at the time you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you state for the record just how you came to see
this person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I was sitting in the truck at the audio board. We were waiting
for Oswald to be brought down. The press had been told he would not be
transferred until after 10:30 in the morning. That is the only thing I can
tie the time down to, because we were on a standby basis waiting for Oswald
to be moved, and Ruby came to the window of the truck and asked, “Has he been
brought down yet?” He was standing on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t know him to be Ruby at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us how he was dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No; I can’t. All I could see was his face. It is a very small
window. We have curtains, and I think it was one corner unsnapped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have a hat on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I don’t know. He came to the window twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How far apart were the two times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I do not know. It was after 10:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think he could have come to the window earlier than
10:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I don’t know. I don’t believe at the time I saw him at the
window, well, I am almost sure it was after 10:30, because I know I was
sitting there. We were on a standby basis and waiting, and he did not mention
Oswald’s name, that I can remember.</p>

<p>It was, he just said, “Has he been brought down yet?” And everybody knew
who he was talking about, or I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now have you seen Ruby since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many times, do you suppose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I don’t know. It was over—I was a witness during the trial.
I saw him before I was a witness, and I saw them bring him into the courtroom
one morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, all the times you saw him were in connection
with your function as a TV man covering the trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No, sir; I was asked by the district attorney’s office to go look
at Jack Ruby through the door of the courtroom prior to being a witness, to make
sure that he was the same man that I saw come to the truck. And then I
saw him while I was a witness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you did look through the door at the district attorney’s
request and saw Jack Ruby, what opinion did you reach?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I knew it was the same man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you subsequently saw him in the court when you testified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you willing to say that the same man who was Jack Ruby
in the courtroom was the man whom you described as coming up to the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. That was the same thing I told the Dallas district attorney,
that the only reason I remember Jack Ruby is because within minutes after
the shooting we had mug shots of Ruby on camera from the third floor of
the city hall. And if it hadn’t been for those mug shots being in such a close
time after he came to the window, I probably would never have remembered
seeing him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you tell us the mental process you went through in relating
the face at the window to the mug shots?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Well, about four of us pointed at him at the same time in the
truck. I mean, we all recognized him at the same time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As being the man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. That had come to the truck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is your thought that that man who had peeked through the
window had done so only a matter of minutes before, or would it have been
an hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I can’t say. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But as you sit here now, your best impression is that—better
still, your opinion is that the man who did look through that window and asked
you, “Have they brought him down yet?” was Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As a matter of fact, you have confirmed that a number of times,
to wit, almost immediately after when you saw the mug shots on TV, and then
at least on two other occasions when you looked in through the window in the
courtroom, and again when you were face to face with him in the courtroom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there any possibility that your seeing him as you have described
it through the window, could have been on the previous day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No. He may have been there, but I don’t remember him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This event that you are talking about did not take place on the
previous day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No. I have heard people say that he was on, that they had
seen him on the sidewalk, but I did not, to my knowledge. There were so many
people; a lot of people asked questions, and most of the time I say, “I don’t
know,” hoping they will go on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As I understand, the thing that makes it certain in your mind
that he was Jack Ruby is because of the association of the face that peered to
you in the window and the mug shots that came through the camera right after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The two link together in your mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. That is the only thing. I would not have remembered him if
it had not been for the mug shots. There were so many people, there is no way
I believe that I could have remembered him. And if he hadn’t come back to
the window the second time, I might not have linked it with the mug shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much time was there, do you think, between the two times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I don’t know. I really don’t. I wish I could help but anything
I’d say would be a wild guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Walker, I want to show you a report of an interview that
was had of you by FBI Agents Earle Haley and Robley D. Madland on December
4, 1963, which I have marked for identification as Fort Worth, Tex., April 15,
1964, Exhibit 5315, deposition of Ira Walker, under which I have signed my
name. I would like you to read it, sir, after which I am going to ask you if
there are any errors or any corrections you want to make, anything that has
been omitted, or modifications that you believe to be necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. [Reading report.]</p>

<p>No. I wasn’t the one that said, “I saw him between 7:30 and 8 a.m.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That FBI report which has been identified as 5315, contains the
statement in the middle paragraph reading as follows, to wit:</p>

<p>“Walker said that on the morning of November 24, that the first time he
recalled seeing Jack Ruby was shortly before the mobile unit was set up, which
would have been between 7:30 and 8 a.m. Walker said that he first saw Ruby
shortly after the armored truck was backed into the basement of the Police
Department.” Now would you address your comments to that statement, Mr.
Walker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I believe one of the other boys said he saw him between 7:30 and
8, but it was not me because I don’t remember seeing him. But as far as the
association with the armored truck, now the armored truck was not backed
into there until around 10:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your thought is that when you saw Ruby the first <span class="locked">time——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Was after 10:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was after the armored truck was backed in?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. It was after I was on a standby basis and sitting in my seat in
the truck just waiting for somebody to roll tape.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What does the standby basis mean in the TV industry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. It means to stand by to go on the air any time on call at a
moment’s notice, because we had been told he would be moved after 10:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have any distinct recollection that the first time you
saw him was after the armored truck was moved in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I don’t believe the armored truck was backed in until after
10:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So as I understand it then, with respect to the language in
Exhibit 5315, there are really two corrections that you wish to make. One
is concerning the time 7:30 to 8, and the other is concerning the relation between
your seeing Ruby and the truck backing into the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your thought, then, as I understand, is that it was considerably
later than 7:30 or 8 o’clock, in fact, it was about 10:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Or after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or after, but you think that it was before the armored truck
backed in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It could be either?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. It could be either; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did see him twice, though?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I did see him at the window twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is possible that the first time you saw him, the armored truck
had not backed in and the second time it had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. It is possible; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would your best guess be, considering—well, I don’t want you
to guess. Would your best impression or opinion now be that the time that
you first saw Ruby was less than an hour before the shooting of Oswald took
place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that thereafter, the time that you saw him on the second
time would have been less than an hour, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You do not have any recollection now, as I understand, as to
the time interval between the two times you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No, sir; I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you have said that—perhaps we should repeat what
he told you on each occasion or what he said or asked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. As near as I can remember, he just asked, “Has he been brought
down?” or “Have they brought him down yet?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On both occasions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes; and I am not sure, I probably told him “I don’t know.”
It says here that I said, “No.” But I have no way of knowing yes or no, really,
which is true. We had cameras, and I could see what the cameramen were
doing, but I still really have no way of knowing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Perhaps you’d better describe for the record what you meant
by mug shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Well, as I understand it, from listening on the intercom, we
were told we were going to get pictures of Jack Ruby and that we would have
to get them right away because our people did not have the pictures and would
not be allowed to have them, and I assumed that someone from the police
department would be holding those pictures, because they—we were told to get
the tapes to rolling, because we wouldn’t get a second shot at him. And it
would just be, get them or miss them, and I presume that someone in the
police department was holding those pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In front of a camera inside the jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was that mug shot that you remembered talking about that
immediately brought to your mind “this is the man I saw just before the shooting
of Oswald, or sometime before the shooting”?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now have you been interviewed by any member of the President’s
Commission before this date, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No; only there were some FBI men came to the station, and
I believe they are the men you mentioned here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I meant members of the President’s Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No, sir; not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I have omitted to explore one area. You were called as a witness
in the trial of Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall the general nature of your testimony then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. To state the same thing that I have here, that Jack Ruby
came to the window of the truck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were called by the State?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To the best of your recollection, has your testimony today been
any different from that which you gave at the trial of Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Has there been anything omitted here that was brought out in
the trial of Ruby when you were a witness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No; in fact, it has been covered much better. The State didn’t
bring out the fact that we saw mug shots, and the defense kind of tore me
up on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, when the defense tore you up, I suppose what they were
trying to do is say you simply couldn’t recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. They asked me how long I had known Ruby, which I did not
know him, and they were trying <span class="locked">to——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you give the explanation as to the mug shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But it is a fact that the mug shots, that your connection between
the mug shots did in fact take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes, sir; that is the only real tie, is the fact that we had the mug
shots. I probably wouldn’t have remembered the man coming to the window if
it hadn’t been for the mug shots. I told District Attorney Wade that before
I went in as a witness, but he didn’t follow it up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, to wrap it up, you are saying under oath now that the
man at the window and the man in the mug shots and the man in the courtroom
identified as Jack Ruby were one and the same person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have already testified that you recall the interview of you on
December 4, by FBI Agents Earle Haley and Robley Madland. At the time you
were interviewed, were you interviewed by those agents alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did the interview take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. The two agents, myself, Warren Richey, Johnny Smith, and there
might have been some others, Jimmy Turner was there part of the time—of
course, he introduced us to the FBI men, and I think he had already talked to him
previously.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All of you were interviewed as a group rather than individually,
is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you shown a copy of the notes relative to what your statements
were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No; I have seen no notes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have never seen any draft of the documents which have been
identified as Exhibit 5315?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Today is the first time I have ever seen that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. During the interview, did the FBI agents ask each of you to
speak alone, or was it a composite sort of interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. It was composite. We spoke as we remembered the situation.
I mean, everybody described the whole thing as it progressed along as best he
could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember what the FBI did by way of segregating the
identification of each of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No, sir; I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you anything else to say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="DANIELS">TESTIMONY OF JOHN L. DANIELS</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of John L. Daniels was taken at 10 a.m., on April 1, 1964, in
the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President’s
Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of John L. Daniels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Daniels, I have to read some things to you. Mr. Daniels,
my name is Leon D. Hubert, and I am a member of the advisory staff of the
General Counsel of the President’s Commission. Under the Provisions of the
Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, the Joint Resolution of Congress
No. 137, and the rules of procedure adopted by the Commission in conformance
with that Executive order and the joint resolution, I have been authorized
to take the sworn deposition of you. I state to you now that the general
nature of the Commission’s inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate and report upon the
facts relative to the assassination of President Kennedy and the subsequent
violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald. In particular as to you, Mr. Daniels, the
nature of the inquiry today is to determine what facts you know about the
death of Oswald and any other pertinent facts you may know about the general
inquiry including the parking of the car that belonged to Mr. Ruby at the
parking lot next to you, I think.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Daniels, I understand that you received a letter from Mr. J. Lee
Rankin, General Counsel of the Commission asking you to appear to have your
testimony taken by this deposition. Did you receive that letter over 3 days ago
from today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. It has been longer than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It has been longer than that? All right, now, will you stand
and take the oath, please, and raise your right hand.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes, I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you state your name, please. Sit down, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. My name is John L. Daniels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. My age is 32.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you live, Mr. Daniels?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. 2314 South Boulevard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. South Boulevard, Dallas, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your present occupation? Where do you work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Working out of the Adolphus Garage now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Adolphus Garage? That is connected to the Adolphus Hotel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Across the street from it, but just the name of it. The one
connected to the Adolphus Hotel is onto the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see, is that located at 1326 Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, on November 24, 1963, which was a Sunday, where were
you working?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Working for Norton parking lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Working for Ralph Norton, Norton’s Auto Park?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes, auto park right across from Western Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Main Street, 2335 Main.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there another parking lot next to yours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. The one just—used to be the same lot, but divided it up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Theodore Jackson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. He is the colored fellow working in the next block to me.
On Sunday our lots work together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you go on duty at the parking lot, Mr. Daniels,
on November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was the day that Oswald was shot in the jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. It was somewhere around, I imagine it was after the shot was
made when I went on, and went down in the city hall, I imagine it was <span class="locked">about——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I am talking about the time you went to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Time I went to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Somewhere around 12 o’clock, I believe it was. I never did
pay much attention to the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you come from when you went to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. I came from home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You hadn’t been hanging around the Main Street prior to that,
had you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No; I hadn’t been hanging around there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what <span class="locked">time——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. I lived about a street—I was staying at the Pacific Hotel, and
had the radio on and heard about the shooting and got up and come on out
of there then, about 2 blocks from there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words you were in your home at the Pacific Hotel on
Pacific Avenue, Pacific Street and turned the radio on and heard the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then you came down to the parking lot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Ambulance came by blowing, and I got up and came on down
to the parking lot then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You saw the ambulance go by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. I heard it blowing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. They had the sirens blowing was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see. Do you know Mr. Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No, sir; I don’t know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know anything about the parking of his car on Mr.
Norton’s lot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No, sir; car was parked next lot to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes; I seen the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you know it was Mr. Ruby’s car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Well, detectives come down and picked up the car. Me and
this Jackson was there together and he put a ticket on the car so me and him
went over to the car and he got a dime to call—to bring the key down there
to unlock the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who did that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. One of the detectives brought that letter you all sent to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He got a key, you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. He called back to the city hall for them to bring Jack Ruby’s
key down. They searched the car good. The car was open. He had a dog laying
in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The windows were open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. One was cracked, and didn’t lock the car. The trunk was locked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The trunk was locked but the doors of the car were not locked
and there was a little crack in the window for air, I suppose, for the dog?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when the detectives came they could open the car? They
didn’t need a key for that, did they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No, sir; they didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they get a key from anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. I don’t know if the key ever come. I think one of them had a
key fit it or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Fit what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. They unlocked the trunk before the man got back with the key
or something. I could tell, so they said, “We’ll take the car. Call for the dog
wagon to come and get the dog.” Then they decided they’d take the car on down
to the pound, the city pound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the dog was taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Take the dog with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They took the dog with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, about how long after you got to work did the detectives
come to the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Oh, in maybe an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. An hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes, sir; something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you think they got there about 1 o’clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. I don’t know. Somewhere—could have been a little later than
that when they got there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time was it when they left with the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. I don’t know. The boy didn’t punch the ticket out. He just
picked it off, because they didn’t pay the ticket out. I don’t know what time,
exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long were the detectives there from the time they first
came until they left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. They stayed there about 5 or 10 minutes, and then the key, one
of them had a key fit it. Must have been his car keys or something, and they
left with the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know where they found that car key that fit the car,
do you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No; I really don’t know, because I walked back on over there.
They raised the trunk up and looked in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you look in the trunk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. When they started looking in the trunk they said, “Well, we’d
better take the car on over to the pound.” And searched the car there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They did not take anything out of the car at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Didn’t take anything out of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know this man named Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No, sir; sure didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know whether Mr. Ruby had ever parked his car there
before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you recognize the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No, sir; sure didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been working for the Adolphus Garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Been down there about a month now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Daniels, do you know anything that might throw any light
on the general inquiry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No, sir; that’s all I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you been interviewed by any member of the Commission’s
staff before this deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes; one or two fellows, say the FBI, and talked to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They are members of the FBI, but I am talking about persons
who identified themselves as members of the staff of the President’s Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No, sir; I <span class="locked">don’t——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have not been interviewed, for example, by me before this
deposition?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. That’s right, I haven’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir. Thank you very much. I think that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Okay.</p>

<h2 id="JACKSON">TESTIMONY OF THEODORE JACKSON</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of Theodore Jackson was taken at 9:30 a.m., on April 1, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the
President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, this is the deposition of Theodore Jackson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Jackson, my name is Leon Hubert, I am a member of the
advisory staff of the General Counsel of the President’s Commission. Under
provisions of Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, a Joint Resolution
of Congress No. 137, and the rules of procedure adopted by the Commission in
conformance with the Executive order and the joint resolution, I have been
authorized to take the sworn deposition from you, Mr. Jackson. I state to you
now the general nature of the Commission’s inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate and
report upon the facts relating to the assassination of President Kennedy and the
subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>In particular, as to you, Mr. Jackson, the nature of the inquiry today is to
determine the facts that you know about the death of Oswald and any other
pertinent facts you may know about the general inquiry, in particular about
parking of Mr. Jack Ruby’s car in that lot on that Sunday, as it were. Now, I
understand that you have not received a letter of request which was sent to you
in care of the All State Parking lot, at Main and Expressway. Then under the
rules adopted by the Commission every witness has the right to have a 3-day
written notice prior to the taking of his deposition, but the rules of the Commission
also provide that a witness who has not received that 3-day written notice
may waive it if he sees fit to do so. Are you willing to waive it and have your
testimony taken without the 3-day——</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you stand and raise your right hand. Do you solemnly
swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you
God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. State your name, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Theodore Jackson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Thirty-six.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you live, Mr. Jackson? Your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. 2649 Carpenter Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Carpenter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation, Mr. Jackson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Parking cars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Parking cars?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. 2001 Pacific.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All State?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. That is All State Parking, uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you sometimes work at other branches of All State Parking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. 2305 Main Street where the car was parked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that on the corner of Main and Pearl Expressway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. That is the onliest place I work, where the—Western Union<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
is across the street and the city hall is a block up the street where he shot
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is just about the corner of Main and Pearl Expressway, and
you gave the number as 2535?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. 2035.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you on duty working at the All State Parking lot on Main
Street on Sunday, November 24, 1963, which was the Sunday after the President
got shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Well, I don’t know if it were Sunday. I was on duty when Mr.
Ruby shot Oswald. I mean, I was on the lot the Sunday he shot him, but
he was already parked there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t remember what date it was but you do remember that
it was the Sunday that Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Uh-huh, his car was parked on my lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whose car was parked on your lot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Mr. Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know him before that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No, I didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Never seen him before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you get on duty that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Around noon, always come down around noon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it correct to say then when you came on duty Oswald had
already been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I think he had already been shot, because it was a lot of people
around the city hall up there and John L. Daniels—John L. Daniels was
already on duty. He was working the Norton block right next to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Belonged to Ralph Norton, Mr. Ralph Norton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you spell that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Mr. Ralph Norton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Ralph Norton? N-o-r-t-o-n?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir; R-a-l-p-h.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, Daniels worked on the parking lot next to the
one you were working on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that parking lot belonged to this Ralph Norton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you say Daniels was already on duty when you came on
duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, he was there when I got there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you talk to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No, I didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you say Mr. Ruby’s car was already parked on your lot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. It was parked on my lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Well, I didn’t know whose car it was until these two detectives
came down and was searching the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, will you describe what kind of an automobile it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. It was an Oldsmobile, two-door sedan, white.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you ever seen it before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How can a person park on your lot without there being any
attendant there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Well, they pull in and leave their car, and take the key and
lock it up if you are not there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there anybody on duty before you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No, sir; I unlocked the door and opened up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Opened up? Well, the parking lot is not a closed parking lot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No, sir; it is open 7 days a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is an open lot so that when you say you unlocked the door,
what do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. The office door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are there any chains or anything to keep a person from driving
right on in so that before anyone comes on duty any person can drive in and
leave his car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Drive in and leave it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And if they depart before one of the attendants comes, well,
then, they don’t pay anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. They pay it when they get back. I put a ticket on the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No, you misunderstood me. If they leave before you get there,
then, of course, <span class="locked">you——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There would be no payment, but if you find a car there when
you get <span class="locked">there——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. If it is not monthly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Someone that pays by the month and those cars you would
recognize, or have some sort of a seal on them to indicate that they pay by the
month?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You know the cars?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Ruby did not park by the month there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you came up and saw this car did you put a ticket on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I put a ticket on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there any other cars parked in the lot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir; about, oh, I guess about six—about six more besides
his, five or six more, I disremember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, and you put a ticket on the car, did you notice whether the
car was open, or closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No, sir; I didn’t. I just looked at the car and the key was
gone. The keys wasn’t in the switch, and I just got a ticket, just stamped the
ticket and put it on the windshield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there a dog in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir; I think so. It was—yes, it was a dog in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there any window open so that the dog could get some air?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I never looked whether there was or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did that seem strange to you that there—somebody had a dog
in the parked automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Well, it did, two detectives came down, and they started searching
the car, but they were looking for a key.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were they able to open the door of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I don’t think the car was locked up, because they came down,
well, they wasn’t—it couldn’t have been locked up, because they were looking
for the key to the switch, because they wanted to take the car to the pound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Before we get to that, how long after you got on duty and put
the ticket on Mr. Ruby’s car, did the detectives arrive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Oh, about an hour or so, I guess. I believe about an hour or so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, did they have any difficulty in opening the doors of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I never even noticed them until they was out there to the car.
I was listening to the radio about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you say with reference to the detectives, what they
were doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. They were searching—they searched the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The doors were open by the time you saw it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. They was searching the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, answer my question, were the doors open or do you
remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. When I seen them they were searching they must have been
open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say “searching,” do you mean they were searching
the back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Looking for a key. They said they were looking for a key.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Key to what? The ignition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. The ignition key, and I think the trunk key, and they opened
up the trunk and there was a bunch of sacks in the trunk. I don’t know what
was in them, and after they told me they was detectives, that was Jack Ruby’s
car, and I just took the ticket off the car and they were going—said they was
going to take the car to the pound, and said something or another about calling
somebody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Doing what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Said something or another about calling somebody, some of
his relatives or something to see what they wanted to do with his dog. They
were going to take the car to the pound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they do anything with this dog, that you know of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I don’t know. They took the car to the pound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened to the dog? Was it still in the car when they
took it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes; the dog was still in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they make any calls that you knew of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. They went over and used the other telephone in John L. Daniels’
office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. See, I don’t have one in mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you say you got to work about 12 o’clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes; around noon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you been hanging around before going on duty, or come
<span class="locked">directly——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No; I come directly from home and went to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t pass by the jail, or look around the jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you sure it was 12 o’clock, and not 11 o’clock, that you went
on duty, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. It was around noon somewhere. I don’t know—I don’t know
just what time it was, because I usually come down around 1 o’clock, but sometimes
I get down there a little earlier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was after half past 11 in the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir; I’m pretty sure it was after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you first find out that Oswald had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Well, we had a boy that run the lot during the day through
the week and had a radio down there, and I usually turned it on when I come
in, and when I put it on that was what was on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The news was that he had already been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know a man by the name of Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No, sir; I didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, have you ever been interviewed by any member of the
President’s Commission staff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Never been interviewed by me before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, Mr. Jackson, I think that is all. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go to school there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Here to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you been in Dallas ever since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you complete your education in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No—I didn’t complete it—I went to the 11th grade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I mean what education you do have was finished in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It was finished in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How far did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. 11th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At what age did you quit school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. At 16, I think—16 or 17.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How have you been occupied since you left school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. <span class="locked">Well——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean, what work have you done?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. A number of things—should I go through them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; just briefly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I was—right after I left school, I was caddymaster at River
Hills golf course. I left there and went to—well, I had a job at Vick’s Cafeteria
in the Republic Bank Building—no, no—I’m sorry, it was Wilson’s Cafeteria,
and then Vick’s Restaurant; then Vinson Still.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is Vinson Still a corporation or individual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It was a corporation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What kind of work did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Cut stainless steel—I mean—filled orders of stainless steel
and magnesium—cut magnesium. I started out as a porter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, continue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Then, I did a prison stretch for marihuana for 3 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you convicted in State court?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. State court.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When were you convicted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. 1958.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you were sentenced to how many years in prison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Five.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many did you actually serve?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was on a charge of possession? Possession and sale of
marihuana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the date of your release?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. The date was March 18, 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that on a parole situation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; that was discharged.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Discharge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How was the time reduced then from 5 years to approximately
3?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, in this State you do 3 years or do 5.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean for good time and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, for good time you can reduce some of that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The point is, that when you left the prison you were not on
probation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I was not on probation. When I came back I started to work
at the Holiday Hills Apartments, belonging to the Hunt Oil Co., and Bowman
Real Estate, I think it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s in Dallas here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. In Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What kind of work did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I was a maintenance man out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At the Holiday Hills Apartments?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s owned by the Hunt Oil Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is the Bowman Real Estate?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he was the one that built it, I think he built it and
sold it for half interest or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What Hunt is that in the Hunt Oil Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It’s H. L. Hunt Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Mr. Hunt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Lamar Hunt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I have seen him—I don’t know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that the same man as H. L. Hunt Oil Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s the same man—he was in charge, and when I left the
Holiday <span class="locked">Hills——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, before you leave the Holiday Hills and Hunt Oil Co., you
say that you have seen a Mr. Hunt, but have not talked to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, sir; I have never talked to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that one you saw was H. L. Hunt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, no—it was Lamar, and a few of his brothers, a couple of
his brothers, I think it was—it was on the 4th of July or a Labor Day, I don’t
know which one it was, I don’t recall, and they had a party out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know the relationship between Lamar Hunt and H. L.
Hunt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Father and son.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you never met H. L. Hunt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you have seen him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who employed you over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. A Mrs. Pierson was the manager. I dropped in one afternoon
for a job and she gave me the opportunity to work there for a week to
see if I did a good job, so she hired me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you were employed by this lady to work for the Holiday
Hills Apartments, did they know you had been in the penitentiary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long after you left the penitentiary did you apply and
receive the job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Let’s see, it was sometime during the summer of 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About the middle of the summer, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I’m pretty sure—I think it was about the middle of the
summer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do in the meantime, between March when you
left the penitentiary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I mostly just picked up odd jobs trying to make a
buck, just odd jobs, whatever I could find to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you kept out of trouble ever since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes. I have an application in for full pardon, recommended
by Mr. “Bill” Decker himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By Mr. who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. The sheriff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know the sheriff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you come to know him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, mostly through—I’ve seen him more times through
going down to visit Jack, because you had to go through Mr. Decker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know Mr. Decker prior to the time that Oswald was
killed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not too well—well, no, in a way I did and in a way I didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, explain that, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Back when I was a caddymaster at River Hills golf course
someone broke in it out there and I was picked up on investigation, which someone
else testified to later that they had did it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At first they thought you had done it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes—that’s when I first met Mr. Decker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How often did you see him after you left the penitentiary and
until the shooting of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I only saw him—let’s see—we will come back to about
January 1962—I had got a job at Marilyn Belt Factory just across from the
county jail, and I used to see Mr. Decker, you know, I used to pass him on the
street there and I would always speak to him, which he always would speak
back, which he would always speak back to everyone who speaks to him
whether he knows them or not, and I guess I saw him 10 or 15 times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you ever in his office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not until after the slaying of Lee Oswald, the one time was
for the investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, in other words, after you left the penitentiary your acquaintance
with Sheriff Decker amounted to nothing more than seeing him on the
streets and saying “hello?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never conversed with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have any reason to believe he knew your name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, he didn’t know my name until after the slaying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us why he has agreed now to support your application
for a pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I believe that Mr. Decker did some investigating on
me and when I went in to ask him, he went through the procedure of having
my record checked, since I have been out, and before he recommended me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell me, in connection with the application for a pardon, is it
necessary to get the approval of the sheriff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It is necessary to get the approval of some officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you chose the sheriff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. And I chose the sheriff. I was either going to choose the
sheriff or Mr. Gilmore, the head of the vice squad. He has been in the club
lots of times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Gilbert—I don’t know whether he’s in charge of the vice
squad for the city or not, but he is around and he has been to the club, checking
in like he does, like policemen do, and he got to—he would always speak to
me when he come in and he was always very nice and I was always very nice
to him and I’m pretty sure he had some checking done on me, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, in any case, you chose Sheriff Decker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. But I chose one of the two of them because I didn’t know
anybody else to approach—any other officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, I think we had left off with our analysis of your
employment since you left the penitentiary, that you had worked for the Holiday
Hills Apartments—how long did you work for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Oh, about 8 or 9 months—it wasn’t too long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that employment began, in the summer of 1961?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, and it ended a little before Christmas—I think it was
around the 1st of December.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of 1961?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Of 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, it would hardly have been 9 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I believe that’s right—I imagine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You think then, you actually began to work with them probably
in May or June of 1961?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. <span class="locked">Well——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you see, if you left just before Christmas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. You know, come to think of it, I think it was, because it
was around the spring—so it must have been about the last of April or the
1st of May.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, you worked for about 7 months and left around Christmas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the reason for your leaving?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Discharged.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What caused it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I don’t know the cause.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ask?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I have recently, 5 or 6 days ago—Mrs. Pierson who is
not there any more, and I wanted to ask her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mrs. Pierson being the lady who had originally employed you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She was the one who discharged you, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what about 5 or 6 days ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I wanted to contact her to find out why I was discharged.
I have a reason—it was because of one of the maids out there, but I’m not for
sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean you suspect that it was on the complaint of one of the
maids?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, yes; something like that—something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, you did not reach Mrs. Pierson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you really don’t know even now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I’m still trying to find out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ask her at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I asked her at the time and was refused to be told why.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was Christmas, 1961—what was your next employment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Let’s see—at the Marilyn Belt Factory in January.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s the place that’s right opposite the sheriff’s office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right opposite the sheriff’s office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you work for them? Commencing in January
1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I worked for them 2 months, then I got the job at the Carousel
Club with Jack and I held both of the jobs for about a month and it got to
where I had to let one go, so I let the Marilyn Belt Factory go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that you began to work at the Carousel Club in about
February of 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you get employment with the Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Let’s go back—it wasn’t in February—you see, I started
to work at the Marilyn Belt Factory in February, and I worked about 2 months
with the Marilyn Belt Factory—that’s February and March and April—3 months,
because I started to work for Jack the 1st of May, about the second day in May.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. In 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then you worked both places for about a month?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. For about a month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which would take you to June 1, 1962, and then you had to
make a choice, so you decided to go with the Carousel Club and you left the
other job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, coming back to the question—how did you come to be
employed in May of 1962 at the Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Just walked in and he was sitting down talking to some
man—I have never saw him before—yes, I have—he was a waiter over at the
Baker Hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear that there was an opening there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you known Jack Ruby before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there any advertisements in the paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there any sign on the door indicating that help was
needed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you help us in ascertaining why you just walked in to
get the job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, it was on a Saturday morning and I decided I would
go look for me a night job some place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What you wanted was a night job to supplement your income?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. What I wanted was a night job, so I decided the club would be
the best thing, so I went to three or four clubs, and when I went to Field and
Commerce, I was going to go to H. L. Green’s for a cup of coffee or something
like that and I started back up Commerce and I saw the door open there and I
just pulled over and went in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you had tried three or four other places before
you went to the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On this same Saturday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. On this same date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was about the 2d of May, I think you said, in 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right—about the 2d of May, I’m pretty sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was in the first part of May, do you think?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was about the first part of May, you think, and it was a Saturday
morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I have a calendar for 1962 before me, and it shows the first Saturday
in May was the 5th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It was the 5th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I’m showing you that calendar for 1962; does that help you any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, you see—why I said the 2d was later on, we tried to
figure—I was signing a couple of checks about 2 weeks later and we were trying
to figure out what date I started so I could fill out a W-2 form and we got to
counting the days and we counted back to the 2d, so this was on a Saturday—it
was on a Saturday, so it must have been the 5th. You see, things always happen
so fast when you was around Jack because he was just like this—flighty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The day you walked in there, he was in the Carousel—he was in
the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, he was sitting down there, just sitting in the club at a
table.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He was talking to a waiter from across—it was a waiter
across the street which worked up there that night, that Saturday night, and he
never worked there any more, but that only one night that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, tell us how you introduced yourself and how he came to
employ you, and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I asked him if he needed any help at night and he said
as a matter of fact he did and he said, “I’ve been looking for a clean-cut young
man like you,” and so he said a few things—he asked me had I ever been in
any kind of trouble and naturally I told him, “No.” I always tell people “No,”
unless it is absolutely necessary, so he said to come back that night, so I went
back that night and worked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you fix your salary at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, not exactly. We fixed the salary the next day, no, the
Monday—the following Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what was that salary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That salary was $40 or $45 a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did it remain that way or did you get an increase?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, it remained that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never got any more than that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; just plus tips.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your job around there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, at first it was just bartending and then it got to be—it
was bartending, then it got to be straightening the place up a little bit because
there was another man that came in, Howard Haynes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Howard Haynes?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, but he always did sort of a half job, and so then it got
to be where I spent most of the afternoon there just taking phone calls and
reservations and things like that, and taking care of all of the buying and things
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What do you mean by taking care of the buying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, taking care of the buying—whatever that had to be
bought—whatever stock they needed—no food, just beer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, as I understand you, as you stayed on longer,
you assumed more responsibility?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And more duties?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right, and they got me to where I was doing the hiring of
the waitresses and contacting different peoples about acts and things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Ruby delegated the authority to you to actually employ people,
both as waitresses and for acts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, not actually employ them for acts, but contact them—he
already knowed who he wanted and I just contacted certain persons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you would do the legwork, shall we say, about
getting these acts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Certainly not all of them, just some of them—when he didn’t
have time to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever tell Jack, or did he ever find out you had been in
the penitentiary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I never told him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know whether he knows to this day about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I don’t know whether he knows—you see, I never told anyone
connected with him until the trial, and then I told Mr. Phil Burleson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you testify in the trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had been subpenaed, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I was subpenaed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did it get to the point where you handled the money of the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How was the money handled?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I was—I always had $225 in my possession. That
was for a bank every night, you know, to start things off and at the end of the
night when I checked up, I would give him the receipts for the night and I
would take what I had put in back to the safe and so, with the buying on
Thursdays, when I took care of all of the purchases, I would give him the
receipts and the total of the receipts—he would return the money to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you always kept for making change for beginning
the night’s operation, the sum of $225.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the next day after the night’s operation, you would turn
over to <span class="locked">him——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I would always give it to him that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The same night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, sir; the same night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You would give him everything but the $225.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what about paying for the goods that you bought?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, that was—happened the same way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it a cash basis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; most everything was cash.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You would pay it out of the $225.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I would pay it out of the $225, and he would give me the
money back that I had spent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, that, you began with $225 each night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And usually he would put the money in the safe, that is to say,
the amount of $225?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, I would put the $225—I kept that money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You kept the $225?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I put it in the safe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s the $225 only?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Just the $225 only.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you have a safe, when did you get one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he always has had a little old safe in the office. This
was a little cabinetlike thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that one that had a slot on the side of it, so you could slip the
money in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, not that one. He had just recently bought that one—I
would say it was in October last year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Previous to the safe which was bought in October, there was
another safe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he kept that in the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He kept that in the office—it was a cabinet you opened
with a key. It had little cabinet drawers in it and some little small ones.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It didn’t have a combination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; no combination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it a filing cabinet like—it had two file cabinet drawers,
about the size of those on the left-hand side there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let the record show that the witness is pointing to the usual
legal size four drawer steel cabinet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. But only two of those on the left-hand side and on the right-hand
side at the top it was three or two little drawers, about the size of one
of those stacks and one about that deep, where you could open it with a key.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, it really had two keys?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, just the one—the same key would fit the one on the
inside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack keep the money that you gave him as to the profit
over the $225 in that place, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, he never kept anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did he handle that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I don’t know—he usually would go to the bank once or twice
a week, or, he mostly kept—usually he kept the payroll on him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have a checking account?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He had an account at the Texas Bank—no, at the Merchants
State Bank on Ross Avenue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it your impression that he would deposit this cash in that
account?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. There was always a little money in that account, but I don’t
know whether he deposited it or not—all of it in that account or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he pay his bills, such as for the stripteases and the band?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Every Sunday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In cash or check?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. In cash.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he paid all the supplies and purchases in cash, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. In cash.</p>

<p>Hr. Hubert. Do you know if he paid anything by check?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the rent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the rent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. The rent was paid by cash with a cashier’s check.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever purchase a cashier’s check?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He would give you the money and you went to the bank and got
the cashier’s check for it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Cashier’s check.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But when you said a little while ago that he would take the
money and go to the bank, what did you mean?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he would always go two or three time—I’m sure—a
week, that he was at the bank. I don’t know whether he deposited money or
not, but he did have an account and there was an account there in the name of
the Carousel Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But do you know of your own knowledge whether he used it as
a checking account normally is used?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It was used as a checking account, but I never—I have seen
checks that he had written, that was, you know, after they went through and
then he got them back—I had seen those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Canceled checks—you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, no; checks that went through the bank already and went
through his deposit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s what I mean by canceled checks—in other words, after the
check goes through, it is returned to the maker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Returned—yes—right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have a lot of those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I saw quite a few small payments on different things, but
I don’t know whether he had a whole lot of them or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I am trying to get at, Mr. Armstrong, is whether or not
Ruby kept the income from the Carousel on his person or did he deposit it in
the bank?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I believe that the biggest part of his money, he kept it
in his purse on his person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you any idea how much he would have on his person in
that way as an average?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, it would be hard to say, because I have seen times when
he would come in and he would have quite a bit of money in his pocket, but it
would all be, you know, rubber bands—wrapped around with rubber bands, and
he never would take it a’loose or anything like that. A few times he would get
it all mixed up in his pocket and he would straighten out the tens and the ones—separate
the ones from the fives, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who made the payroll?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He made the payroll.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Didn’t you ever do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. After the slaying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No, I mean before that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you assist him in making the payroll?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I didn’t work on Sunday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that’s when he paid everybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s when he paid everybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you do know he paid by cash?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He paid by cash.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see him take any money to his automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What would he do with it when he put it in his automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. What would he do with it? He would put it in his trunk—that
he had in his pocket he would keep in his pocket—and that he had in his
little moneybag he would put it in his trunk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He had a moneybag in the trunk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He had a little sack—the same one he carried his pistol in,
in a little Merchants State Bank, a little moneybag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the pistol was in that bag?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Usually it would be in one of those little money bank bags.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see him carry the pistol on his body?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; it would always be in a little bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There was no occasion at all when you ever saw him have that
pistol in his pocket or stuck in his waist belt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what he kept the pistol for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I always assumed he kept it for—because he carried
the cash on him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, the pistol wouldn’t do him much good in the trunk of
the car if he had the cash on his body, would it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; not much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you any other reason then to suggest as to why he did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he would always bring it in the club at night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Pistol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It was brought in just in case he was robbed or something
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, let’s see—we have a little difference there—I had understood
you to say that the pistol was always kept in the bag which was in the
trunk of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. But I said he would always bring it in when he would come
to the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see, but when he would bring it in, he would not put it on
or keep it on his person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would he bring it in in the bag?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He would bring it in in the bag and put it in the office
back there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, there would be the money and the pistol and the bag that
were all in the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. All in the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then at night he would take the money and the pistol, which
were in the bag, and bring it out to the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. And bring it out to the car, but most of the time the money
that he had in his bag would be left in the car, unless he was up early in the
day and was handling cash—he just left it in the office some place because he
wasn’t going back out, but if he left, and went home to get dressed or something
like that, and come back about 9:30 or 10 o’clock, he would lock the money, if
he had it in the back in the trunk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it fair to say that almost every night he would bring the
pistol from the car to the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; to the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then when he left at night, he would carry the pistol back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it was always in the bag?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Always in the bag, that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did he keep the pistol in the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Back in the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see him use it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t mean by shooting anybody, but by hitting somebody with
it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I never saw him use it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us what sort of man he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Worried and disturbed always.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, how did that manifest itself so that you could tell that
he was worried and disturbed always?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Now, I’ll tell you this—there was always—if he was sitting
down inside the club in the daytime at one of the tables and some people came
in, he would always want to hold a conversation with them, he would always
want to talk about something, and I have seen numbers of times when someone
had said something about a certain thing, he would get angry about it without
even knowing it—he would just get angry, just like that, but that would pass
over in a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When he got angry, how did he act?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He would always let people know if they said anything
that he didn’t like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did he act?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Sort of like—ungentlemanlike in a nice way—let me see
if I can explain it any better?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I wish you would.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It was like—I’ll give you an example, which is the best way
I can explain it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I have seen at times when he would walk up to someone
that had the feet out in the aisle and the girls couldn’t get by or some man
doing something that he didn’t have any business, like hitting the girls when
they passed by, or something like that, and they would tell Jack—if he was
in a certain mood or something was bothering him, he wouldn’t go over and
say—ask his customers who were spending money in his club, in a nice way
not to do that, he would just hit him on the shoulder like this and say,
“Watch it, Buddy, I don’t allow that in my place”—you know—real mean
like—which is something that I never approved of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He did that quite often?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Quite often, and that’s the way it would happen with any
stranger.</p>

<p>Now, if he knew someone, he would always hold off or get someone else
to do it. If he knew somebody and they were doing something he didn’t
like, he would always get me or one of the girls to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We started off this sequence of questions by your statement that
he was always worried and disturbed, I think was the phrase, and you have
given me that example. Weren’t there some times when he was not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. There was very few times when he was not and I always
had the feeling that if he had that smile and talking and laughing, if it lasts
all night, I always had the feeling that he would still have that worried and
disturbed look and expression, later on after the club closed, somewhere after—I
don’t know—after he got in bed or the next morning or something like that.
It never lasted long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You got along all right with him, didn’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. We got along—we was always arguing, differences of opinion
and things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he nasty with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not—I wouldn’t say he was nasty. I would say if I didn’t
know him—I would say he was nasty. I would say that I would go so far as
to say that he was even cruel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. To me and to a lot of the employees.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Give us some examples of the cruelty you are speaking of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, you could say—we had a speaker in the corner, a high
fidelity speaker over in the right-hand corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. A loudspeaker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, in the right-hand corner and it had to be turned on
individually. It had to turned on or it wouldn’t come over the system and it was
my job to see that it was turned on every night, and there was times I was
too busy and had too many things to do and forgot about it, but not that often,
and if he came in—the first thing he checked was the sound. The MC was
on stage and if he couldn’t hear that box over there, he would come straight
to me and it was like I had took half of the club away or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What would he say or do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he would just get all riled up about that—he would
just get all riled up about that one little incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say “all riled up,” that’s your own words of description
of what he was doing, but we don’t get just what his physical acts were
unless you tell us. What is “riled up”? Raising his voice, cursing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Raising his voice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Throwing his voice—throwing his arms about, hitting people,
doing what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, not hitting people—he wouldn’t ever hit anyone, but
it always the impression that he might. There was always the feeling that
he might.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did his facial expressions change?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Sort of like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he curse?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No—no more than—the only curse word that he would
use more when he did use it was damn it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, on occasions like he got all riled up, as you have told
us, would it consist of calling you a fool or threatening to fire you or raising
his voice, cursing you, what was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Threatening to fire me would be the thing, because he fired
me 50 times or 100 times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Apparently you didn’t stay fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He threatened my job every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He threatened your job every day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Almost every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then what would happen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Nothing—if I left he would call me back. If I left there
fired, all I would have to do is come down and open the club up the next day
and go on back to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He wouldn’t tell you you were fired, stay away; you wouldn’t
even talk about the subject any more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I can understand that that would happen after you had gone
through that firing and rehiring once or twice, but first of all when you got
fired, it must have seemed odd to you to go back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, the first time that it actually really happened was one
night he fired me on Saturday night. It was a Saturday night and I usually
had a ride on Saturday night because the last bus run at 1 o’clock, and if I
didn’t catch that ride at 1:30, well, I would have to get a cab, which I can’t
afford to get a cab. It is $1.65. He said something about staying a little late-something—I
don’t know—it was a meeting, I think. He was always calling
meetings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Meetings of whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Of waitresses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. And I said, “Well, I’ve got to catch my ride because I can’t
spend cab fare, and you are not going to give me cab fare,” just like that, and
I walked on out the door and he said, “Just don’t come back no more.” I said,
“Okay,” and before I got downstairs, he had sent one of the girls downstairs to
tell me that my week wasn’t up. It was on Saturday night—I worked during
the day on Sunday to clean floors, and I worked during that day on Sunday
2½ hours cleaning the club up, and I said, “Well, okay, tell him okay, I’ll clean
the club up tomorrow.” Just like that, and went on, because—I don’t know—you
see, I understood Jack, and I knew what his reasons for sending her on
down was—actually not to tell me to clean the floor up but to tell me I wasn’t
really fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was the first time you had gotten fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That was the first time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, you came back the next day and cleaned the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he called about 11 <span class="locked">o’clock——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s on Sunday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Sunday morning and asked me, “Has anybody called,” and
a few other things—he kept one of the dogs down there—he asked me had I
fed the dog. He always asked me had I fed the dog, which he would know
I fed the dogs. You know, and I would always reply, “You know I will always
feed the dogs, why do you keep asking me have I fed the dogs?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Anyhow, on this particular Sunday morning, what happened
about your getting rehired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he just said, “I’ll see you Monday.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And from then on out I take it you figured when he fired you
like that the only thing you would have to do is come back, and that is how it
worked out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, always, and he would come to the bar, I would say three
times a night, and say, “If you can’t do like I want you to, get out. If you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
can’t do the things like I want you to, get out.” Well, there was an opinion
there, because I know I was at the club more than he was and I had my eyes
on more things than he did and if I did a thing I know was right, because I
have already experienced it before, which he <span class="locked">hadn’t——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What are you speaking of there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I’m speaking <span class="locked">of——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I’m talking about the things you say you had observed which
he had not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, about certain things—you see, we had a system going
that one thing that happened was the setups were served in a glass. If you
wanted cold water or whatever you wanted—were served in a glass with the
ice, with about this much room for liquor [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By “this much room” you are talking about 2 inches?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; about an inch and a quarter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. And some customers comes in there quite often and if one
of the waitresses says, “Andrew, this is for so and so—Mr. so and so, and he
wants his drink—he wants his setup filled so and so, in other words, about a
quarter of an inch or an inch from the top, I would do it that way, because I
am trying to satisfy the customer and if Jack happened to walk to the bar and
see it that way, he would get all riled up because that’s Coca Cola he could be
saving, and I never would go through the procedure of explaining it to him—why
I filled it up that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What you are saying, I think, is that you had more of an opportunity
to observe the likes and dislikes of the customers than he did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Than he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see him get angry and actually use physical violence
respecting any patron or anybody at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I have seen him grab a couple of men in the club and
throw them out when they was due to leave—when he asked them to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And when you say “throw them out,” would you explain what
physical activity was involved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No more than grabbing a guy and locking him behind his arm,
you know, catching him through the arms this way [indicating], from behind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And hustling him out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. And hustling him out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see him strike anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I never saw him strike anybody. Of course, it was said to be
a couple of times he did strike someone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember an occasion when a taxicab driver came in there
looking for someone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I wasn’t working there then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have heard about that occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I read about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever hear him threaten to throw any of the girls or
anybody down the stairs of the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. A couple of times, I believe, I have heard him threaten to
throw even a girl down the stairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you distinctly remember the incident about the girl, don’t
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, the one I remember was Diane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, Jack always said that Diane bugged him and I said we
couldn’t afford to lose her because she was a good waitress—she made the club
money and I would say he had told Diane that she had 2 weeks’ notice every
other night for a whole year—they just didn’t get along.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, get to the point about threatening to throw her downstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he had threatened to throw her down the stairs for
some reason or other—I don’t recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he start to do it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He never put his hands on her—he didn’t touch her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never saw him put anybody out by the stair route?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No—just the customers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, when he pushed the customers out, as you explained a little
while ago, he did that by grabbing their arms from the back and hustling them
out, you mean he hustled them downstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Just to the door, the stairs door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There was a door at the top of the stairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. There was a door at the top of the stairs, and he would
automatically give somebody the sign to call the police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you sleep in the club, ever?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, when I first started to work there when I was working
the two jobs, I slept there so I could get up—I could sleep longer and be at
Marilyn belt factory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do I understand from that, that after you left the factory,
that you didn’t sleep there any more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. About 3 or 4 weeks—about 3 weeks I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was Ruby’s habit with respect to arriving at the club and
going home, as far as you could observe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Unpredictable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Unpredictable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean he didn’t have a special time for calling and running
in and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; he didn’t have any special time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He did call about feeding the dogs every day, didn’t he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He called.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was pretty regular?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I would always call his house when I got to the club about—anywhere
from 12 to 1 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You would call his house to check in with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. And then he would probably call me three or four times
that day to see if any calls had come in or if he said, “I’ll be down to the club
at a certain time and you can look for me; I’ll be there about 2 o’clock or about
3:30.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it fair to say that this much was routine, when you got to the
club around midday you would call him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That was a routine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it was also a routine that he would call you daily, three
or four times a day, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whether he came in or not—there was no routine about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No—there was no routine about that. The most routine he
had was about coming in the club at night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He was very seldom there at showtime—that’s 9 o’clock—but
he would always be in by 10 o’clock. In other words, he would always come
in between 9 and 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how long did he stay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He would close up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which was what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Around 1 o’clock, I would say. He would usually spend
more time at the club after the show than anybody else. In other words, if I
was closing up I would be right out; if he was closing up, he would walk around
and he would look for this and he would check that and just a waste of time—if
he had anyone waiting on him they would probably be gone to sleep before he
left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have to wait until all of this was finished before you
left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I would always leave before the last show. In other
words, I caught a 1 o’clock bus; I caught the 1 o’clock bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you weren’t there most of the time when the club closed?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This settlement you made with him every night was really
before the club closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. The settlement was for the bar; on week nights, you didn’t
have any bar which was after 12:15 unless it was near-beer or anything like that,
and I usually checked the bar—checked my receipts and count my money—started
about a quarter to 1 and if there were any sales after I left he would
take them himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that settlement that you and he went through was in his
office, I take it? Or right at the bar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; you see, I would wrap all the money up and put it in a bag
and wrap a rubberband around it. The change is all that was left, with a slip
in the register of how much change it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did the register record the sales?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. The register recorded the sales.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was done with the slip of recordation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It was kept in the files.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ever check to see whether the amount of sales checked
out with the amount of money that you turned over to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Every day; if it was a nickel short he would call me over
the phone or he would tell me about it when I called him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, this checkout would not be done when you
turned over the money to him at night, but, rather, the next day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. You see, I checked it myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Against the cash register?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Against the cash register.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it was supposed to balance out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. And I gave him the receipts, and anytime I walked up and
gave him a receipt, if I was at least a dollar short or anything like that, I
would say, “It’s a dollar short,” and just go ahead on. I would just hand him
the receipts and he would usually stick them in his coat pocket and that’s the
way it always would happen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about Sundays; did you come over then or did you call
him the same way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I would call him on Sundays or he would call me. He
would either tell me on Saturday night to wake him up a certain time on Sunday
morning if he was going to get up early; if not, he would call me. He knew I
would always leave anywhere from between 11 and 12 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know where he lived during the time you worked for
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he lived once on Marsalis, I think it was, right around
the zoo, and I think he lived on Ewing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Those are the only two places you know of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Those are the only two places I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you ever been to either apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I went to both of them—once each.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he living with anybody at either one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. The only one that I ever knowed that lived with him was
George Senator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you didn’t see George Senator working there, did you; you
didn’t see George Senator living with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What you know about George Senator living there comes from
what people told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. From what people told me, and I called and he answered the
phones and things like that, and Jack mentioned the fact that George kept all
the food around and got him to eating again. You see, he usually was on a diet
and certain foods he didn’t eat because he was on a diet, but if they were around
him in his refrigerator he would eat them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was Jack a pretty strong man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He went to the gym quite often and exercised; is that what
you mean—physical?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; I know he went—I called him at the gym a number of
times. If he would tell me he was on his way to the gym, he would be there,
and that was three times a week, I’m sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any opportunity to observe whether he was a
powerful man or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, what you are telling us is he took exercise and went to a
physical exercise club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He took exercise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the dogs that he kept there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, there is nothing much about them—just some dachshunds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many did he have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, at one time—first he had a little dog named Sheba,
which was half Chihuahua or something, I don’t know what it were, and she got
lost, and they were named Clipper and Sheba.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, he had Sheba right up to the last, didn’t he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; he had Sheba right up to the last.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What do you mean, “She got lost”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, no—I mean Sweetie—the little dog that got lost was
named Sweetie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I thought you said Sheba got lost.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Sheba and Clipper were the only ones he had then, and then
Sheba had some puppies and they grew back up to about 9 and he started
giving those away and he kept one of those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He kept all of those at the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; they weren’t all at the club at one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand. What part of the club did he keep the dogs in,
no matter how many he had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. At the room away at the back—he kept them back there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your job was to feed them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I fed them every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he was very strict about that, I take it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He was very strict about it. I would feed the, you know,
the little dogs and play with them sometimes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you had any opportunity to observe Jack’s attitude toward
women?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No more than any other man, especially a single man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, he was not married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; he was always on the make.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he go out any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You said he was “on the make.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. All the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With reference to what kind of women?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Intelligent, beautiful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, do you mean the people who came to the club, or the
waitresses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, some waitresses, some dancers, and some women that
he had invited to the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he date any of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He dated—yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, from him—he told me a few girls he dated, and there
were some girls that told me that they dated him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did any of the girls tell you anything about their sexual relationship
with him, if any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ever tell you about any sexual relationship with any of
them? With women.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No. Not in that sense; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about his attitude toward men from a sexual point of view?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He didn’t have any attitude toward men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You know what I am talking about—did he have any tendencies
that you could observe of homosexuality?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You know what homosexuality is, don’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I suppose you have seen or met perhaps people who are alleged
to be homosexual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I suppose, too, that you are able to recognize some of the characteristics
of people who are homosexuals?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have any of the such characteristics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not that I could observe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you any reason whatsoever to believe that he was a homosexual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No reason at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you any reason to believe whatsoever that he had any
kind of sexual perversion? Do you know what I mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, that he had sexual relationships either with women or men
in other than the normal way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know anything about any possibility of a strange sexual
attitude that he might have had toward these dogs you are talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No more than he loved them. I know that he would come
in the club and he would lay down and take a nap and the dogs, too—Sheba
would probably be lying very close to him, or one of the other little dogs, but
I had a little dog that I did the same way myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I’m getting at is his attitude in relationship to those dogs
was that he loved the dogs in the way that any normal man would love dogs,
and no more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the financial condition of the club, as far as you
know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, before you expand into that, do you know when it
opened, when the Carousel opened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I don’t know when the Carousel opened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was open when you went there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It was open when I went there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know how long it had been open, had you heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, the first was in 1961 or I think of 1960—the last of 1960,
because I think there was a prior club during 1960 there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, the Carousel had been in existence as such and
under that name for about 18 months before you went with it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, why do you think the financial condition of the club was
not good?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, there was—compared to the other two clubs it was not
good, because the other two clubs—the Theatre Lounge and the Colony Club—they
did a lot more business than the Carousel did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you said they did more business, you mean they had more
people in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That would mean, I suppose, something—that there were more
customers than the other place, but was the Carousel making money or losing
money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I would say it was making enough to pay the bills and
paying overhead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever talk to Jack about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; he would always—if we had a month of good business,
he would say, “Business is picking up,” you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever make a calculation yourself—I don’t mean necessarily
by putting it down in writing, but by thinking about what you knew
had come in and what you knew had gone out, to figure out whether it was
making or losing money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, it was making a little, but how much I don’t know.
It lost after the assassination, because I handled all that—all the receipts then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What do you suppose were the average receipts that you know
of, at least, for a week from the time you were there until Ruby went to jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Per week—for a week— oh, I would say about an average
of $900—or a $1,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would that include Sunday nights’ receipts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That would include Sunday night’s.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How would you know about Sunday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Sunday was always a bad night—I would always know what
was the receipts on Sunday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You weren’t in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. But I would always know—I would be the one to file the
receipts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Ralph Paul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us what you know about him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I know that he is a very nice gentleman, a good businessman
and didn’t want to be bothered with the Carousel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have any interest in the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; none whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Financial interest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; financial interest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, sir, I’m pretty sure he had financial interest, but I don’t
know how much it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you said a minute ago he had no interest, you meant
interest in running it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Interest in running the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he own a part of the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, he owned a part of the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know how much?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I don’t know how much it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there any sharing of profits with him that you observed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I never observed any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, as a matter of fact, didn’t he come there, several times a
week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Usually, he came in on Saturday night, if he came in. I
never saw him there over one or two times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Other than Saturday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Other than Saturday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see Jack give him any money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see him go back to the back room and discuss
matters—or just go back with Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I saw him in the office talking and watching television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what makes you believe he had a financial interest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Because he told me—he told me he had a financial interest
in it and Jack said he had a financial interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, both Paul and Ruby told you that Paul had a financial
interest in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Jack told me that he didn’t have no financial interest in
the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Paul told you that he did, but Jack told you that he did not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Jack told me that Ralph Paul had a financial interest in the
club, but he, himself, did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, that Jack himself did not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, did you—did he tell you whether Paul was the only one who
had a financial interest, or were there other people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he said that it was this Mr. Paul and one of his brothers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say which one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Sam Ruby, I think, he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The one that lives in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see him around there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Once—once or twice he came down to help out—once he came
down to help out and he came in two other times that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, in other words, Jack denied that he had any interest in the
Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, sir; right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was his relationship, then, to the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, as manager only.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he get a salary, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He said he got a salary, but I don’t know how much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Other than the two or three times that Sam Ruby came in, did
you ever see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Did I ever see Sam Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I never saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see Ralph, other than the times you saw him at
the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever hear of the S&amp;R Corp.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your understanding of the relationship between that
corporation and the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, it was known as the S&amp;R Corp. doing business as the
Carousel, is the way the thing was supposed to be, and as far as the corporation
was concerned, I understand that Ralph Paul was president, Sam Ruby was
secretary-vice president and there was somebody else who was—well, I believe
Sam Ruby was secretary-treasurer, and Jack was the manager, or something
like that at one time, and then at another time, Jack wasn’t even the manager.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, it was after all this happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. We were trying to find the corporation papers and he took
his name off as being manager of the corporation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did George Senator work at the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Sometimes he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How often?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Oh, I would say he had been there 15 or 20 times working
as a doorman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, do you mean 15 or 20 times during the 18 months you were
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. During the 18 months that I was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That would be about once a month?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. About once—but I think it mostly came in a short period of
time when he had worked there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, the 15 or 18 or 20 times he did come was not on
an average of once a month, but in a sequence of days?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that there were lots of times he was never around there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How often do you suppose you have seen him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Quite often.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. More than the 15 or 20 times that you saw him at the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he was at the club lots of times when he was not
working.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The 18 or 20 times—you mean were the times he worked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was at the club more often than that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How often, as a matter of fact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Oh, once or twice a week, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What would he do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Oh, just come in and have a beer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he stay around a long time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. And visit with friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would he stay around a long time and go home with Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Lots of times he was there when I left, and lots of times he
left before I left, and I have seen him lots of times working, you know, he had
this Texas Postcard thing and I would see him downtown. As a matter of fact,
I helped him move the postcards from where—from some place out in Highland
Park over to Cedar Springs here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know anything about his relationship in a sexual way
toward men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I sure don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In your own opinion, you wouldn’t think he would be classified
as a homosexual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He showed no traits such as you recognize them on homosexuality?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. None whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know Eva Grant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, sir; in a sort of a way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, tell us what sort of way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I have talked to her on the telephone more times
than I have seen her—a number of times more than I have seen her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many times do you suppose you have seen her in the
18 months you have worked there prior to Jack’s arrest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Fifty times, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You talked to her on the telephone far more that 50 times—3 or
4 times more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you see her when you usually saw her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. The first time I saw her was at the Vegas Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you work at the Vegas, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us what you know about the ownership and operation of
the Vegas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Nothing; not a thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack have any interest in it that you heard of—I know
you wouldn’t know about any books or anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he told me he owned the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s what I mean—so far as what you know about it, you
got from him, and that was to the effect that he owned it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That he owned it—right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you know about the relationship of Eva Grant to the
Vegas Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That she was just running the club. She was his sister
and she was taking care of the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack go over there very often?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I don’t know. On Friday and Saturday nights they usually
have a little amateur show over there and we went over there every Friday night,
but that stopped, oh, sometime in the latter part of 1963, and I don’t know
whether he went over there often then or not. He would call me a few times
from over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, the 50 or 60 times you saw her, Eva Grant, would it have
been at the Vegas or the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I had saw her more times since the assassination than
I did before the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Very well, but the 50 times or so you saw her from the time
you first went to work, would that include the number of times you have seen her
since the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. <span class="locked">Well——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Because, I had meant to restrict this inquiry as to the number
of times you had seen her between the time you went to work and the
assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Very few times—very few.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, we have to revise, I think, to some extent, what your testimony
has been, because I have been thinking that you had seen her some 50
times during the period between May 1962, and November 24, 1963, but apparently
I was wrong on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I hadn’t saw her over 10 times on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, there are about 10 times you have seen her in the period of
time prior to the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And where would that have been usually?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I would say three times at the Vegas and the other
seven times at the club. I would say she came in the club seven times and
these times would be on a Monday night, I would say, about seven times she
had been in that club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why do you say 7 instead of, for instance, 12 or 5?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I’m just saying I remember seeing her 3 times—I can
almost pinpoint the times that I saw her. Let’s see—she came there—Monday,
<span class="locked">Tuesday——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, we need not go into the details—apparently you have
some reason you remember seeing her at the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I was going by the times I saw her with a certain
person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was that certain person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I know that I had saw her with a little waitress
named Susie—the first time I saw her at the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right. The next time I saw her at the Carousel she had come
in with some people that I never saw before, and she always introduced me
to whoever she was with if I don’t know them, and the next time she came in,
I think it was the accountant, Mr. Klinman, and then again she came in with
some more people that I didn’t ever know before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Different from the first group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Different from the first group and again she came in by herself
about three times—three times—I’m sure—by herself, alone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That makes about seven or eight times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. At the Carousel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And at the Vegas you saw her three times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Three times—I was at the Vegas Club three times, I think,
and saw her there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, during the period beginning from the time you first began
to work there and until the assassination, how many times did you speak to
her by telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Three or four times a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was that about?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Oh, nothing much—you see you—she would call you and forget
what she called you for, or, just to talk about her troubles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it about the business of the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, no, just about her troubles—just to talk about her
troubles. She will call me, if she needed anything fixed, she wanted me to
tell Howard to stop over and do some repair work for her. I have called
her about something I might need for a second night and I couldn’t get it and if
she had it I would send someone out for it or she would send it over to me,
and things of that nature, but the biggest part of the time she called me was
when she and Jack were in a row with each other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did that happen very often?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. They both—she would cry on my shoulder and he would
cry on my shoulder about each other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did that happen very often?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Very often.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How often during the time you were there and until the
assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Every other week I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I don’t want to pin you down to anything mathematical,
but during the period of 18 months, that’s pretty often.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I would say so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are talking about something like—that would be 70 weeks
roughly, and 18 months, and every other week would be about 35 times they
had rows you know of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I would say about 35 times, if that’s the way the calculation
is there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did these rows come to your attention?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Because they would always tell me. If it was something
she didn’t want to do—if it was something she wanted to do and he didn’t
want to do it, a lot of times it would maybe happen on the telephone from
the club. It was sometimes—difference of opinions, about something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Apparently they patched those things up too, didn’t they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, apparently—they would always be back on good
terms—it was just like, well, they were before, on the same key. In other
words, Jack would get riled up and you will think he was going to walk off
of this building and the next minute he was just as sweet as he could be and
she was the same way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the relationship of the club and Jack to the police
department and the individual members of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I think that the club had a good record and as far
as policemen—there was no relation. There was not ever any certain policemen
come into the club. We had patrolmen stop in for coffee sometimes, never
the same one—hardly ever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would they be in uniform?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. In uniform—just like they do all the other clubs, and you
would have the vice stopping in just like they do the rest of the clubs, walking
around, looking around, never sit down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Wasn’t there some special arrangement with reference to
what they would be charged?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, the policemen always paid the same price as newsmen
and their boys, which was 40 cents on beer, policemen, bellboys, hotel
clerks and things like that and newsmen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They all had a cut rate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. They all had a cut rate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was true of members of the vice squad too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That included members of the vice squad. Of course, I
never seen any members of the vice squad take anything to drink, any beer or
anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you mentioned one particular member of the vice
squad called Gilmore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Mr. Gilmore.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us about him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, Mr. Gilmore is a man that will, I believe and everybody
else believes, and Jack was afraid of Mr. Gilmore—I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know he was afraid of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I know he was afraid of him because he was nervous whenever
Mr. Gilmore was in the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you he was afraid of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No—he would show it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How would he show it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. By—making sure that everything was perfect and if it was
close to curfew then he would say all the glasses and bottles have to be off of
the table by 1:15—12:15 week nights and 1:15 Saturday nights. If Mr. Gilmore
was in the club at that time you would see Jack out in the audience hustling
glasses and bottles off of the table, because he knew that if Mr. Gilmore saw
anything or anybody drinking in there, he was subject to getting a 5-day suspension
or a ten-day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, when Gilmore was in the club he enforced the
rules more strictly than when Gilmore was not in the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Watch over it more strictly, which is something that most
club owners do when there are vice squad members in the clubs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, was the relationship between Ruby and Gilmore different
from the relationship of Ruby and any other member of the vice squad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; you see, the only time—no; not any different, because
if there was any other member of the vice squad in there, which Mr. Gilmore
is the only one I know by name, is because he is the one that most people fear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean he has the reputation of being tougher than any of
the other members of the vice squad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I guess that’s what it is. It’s just something you pick
up. You never saw him arrest anyone, you never saw him close anyone’s
club <span class="locked">up——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he a captain or what was his rank, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. A lieutenant, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know his first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I don’t know his first name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack ever tell you anything about him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; he just said that some of the old time waitresses—we
had one up there by the name of Alice and Jack and some other girl who was
discussing Mr. Gilmore and they were discussing his reputation, and Alice mentioned
the fact that Mr. Gilmore would arrest his mother if he caught her
doing wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is her last name—what is Alice’s last name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Her name is Alice Alexander.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She was what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. She was a waitress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know anybody by the name of Alice Nichols?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I talked to her about twice on the telephone—no, no; not
Alice—this was Mrs. Blackmon, I’m sorry. Alice Nichols?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Alice Reeves Nichols.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I heard the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have never met her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I have never met her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have never talked to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I want to get to the events and your activities, and the
activities of others that you observed during the period just preceding the
assassination of President Kennedy and for a few days thereafter. Now, first
of all, did your routine follow the usual pattern that you have already described
until the date of the assassination of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there anything you can think of that was not ordinary during
that period of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That I can think of that was not ordinary?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No—everything was as usual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you talk to Jack about the forthcoming visit of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; we didn’t discuss the visit of the President. As a matter
of fact, I got behind on the date. I was planning on being downtown that
day—that morning myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, didn’t you ask Jack to adjust your schedule in such
a way that you could go and see the parade and see the President pass by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, my schedule of the President was already passed by
when I got downtown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I’m talking about prior to the time—to November 22—a day
or two before, didn’t you discuss with Jack about going to see the parade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I think I mentioned it to somebody that I would be
over to see the parade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Didn’t you talk to Jack about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I don’t know for sure—it could have been Jack—now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall any comment that he made about going to see the
parade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he seem to be interested in the President’s visit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I remember there was something about a conversation
going on between him and someone that—I was passing by on the way to the
bus—and it was that he seemed delighted that the President was coming to
Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you overheard Jack say something to someone
to the effect that he was glad or delighted that the President was coming to
Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember how long before the assassination you heard
Jack say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I don’t—sure don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there any special plans being made in the club in connection
with the President’s visit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, suppose you start off with your activities on the night
before the President was shot, say the 21st—did you go home at the usual time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. At the usual time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which is to say—1 o’clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. 1 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your time for reporting would have been when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. My time for working was 1 o’clock the next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you report at 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; I was there a little before 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long before 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, you could say—let’s see, I stopped and got a haircut
and I must have been on the 12 o’clock bus from out where I live.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you get up that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It was pretty early, I think I must have gotten up about 10
o’clock or 9:30—about 9 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then you went to get a haircut?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I went to get a haircut.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that’s all you did between the time you got up and the time
you got to the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s all I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you got to the club about what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It must have been about 12:15—12:20, or something like
that, because when I got downtown I could see portions of the parade, you
know, like I got off of the bus at Main and Field—at Main and Akard, I’m
sorry, which is the usual stop, I always get off at Main and Akard, and further
down you could see portions of the parade, but I felt that I had missed the
parade—I didn’t realize that I had missed the parade until I was in the barber
shop and thought, well, maybe I’ll get downtown, I said to myself, and I will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
see some portion of it, but when I got downtown I was surprised to see that
the parade had already moved forward—further down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just for the record, what barber shop did you go to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Moore’s Barber Shop on Scyene Road. I got to the <span class="locked">club——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, before you get to that, wasn’t it your job to see that the
beer was kept on ice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how often did you check that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And when did you do it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s the first thing I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you came in in the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. When I came in in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t have any special days to do it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I did it every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the delivery of the beer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Thursdays.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Only once a week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Once a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what time did that take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Anywhere from 11 on—Thursday. It was usually between
11 and 3 o’clock because I would usually leave the club at 3 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, so you got to the Carousel about what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. About 12:15, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had a key to get in, of course?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes—I went in and I had to use the restroom, and so I
went to the restroom and then I heard a lot of sirens and I listened to the
sirens for a second or two and they got louder and they got more sirens, so
I decided I would go get my transistor and see what was going on, and that’s when
I heard that there had been a shooting at the President or something like
that. Somebody had tried to assassinate the President, or something, and
then I run in and I woke Larry up—Larry was staying there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is Larry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Larry Crafard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was he staying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He was sleeping in a little room there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say you went and woke him up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I woke him up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you do it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well—I shook him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was the door of his room closed or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, the door of his room was—no, it wasn’t closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long had Larry been there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. How long had he been there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He had been there since October, since the last of the State
Fair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us what you know about him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I don’t know anything no more than that he was working
out at the State Fair somewhere and the first time I saw him is when Jack
bought a little something—a little shack or a little house or something that
was built at the State Fair by Olin Lumber Company, I think it was, and
I don’t know who it was—the company that bought it, and Jack bought the
lumber from Olin Lumber Company because it hadn’t been paid for and he had
Howard and Larry to tear it down and bring it to the club, and that’s when
I met Larry is when he and Howard delivered the lumber to the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack tell you that Larry was going to work there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, he told me there was a couple of kids to help haul the
lumber, but there was only Larry and when I talked to him over the phone,
I called him on the phone and told him they was there with the lumber and
after they finished, he told me to give Larry something and let him get a shower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
or something and he would be down to talk to him later. We had a shower
at the club.</p>

<p>So, he went in and showered and this and that, and that night Jack asked
me did we still have the little cot around there that Larry was going to stay
at the club a while—he didn’t have anywhere to live, and I told him, “Yes,”
and showed Larry where he could find it and he was there ever since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you what Larry was supposed to do around the
club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, Larry was supposed to do a little cleaning and things
of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that supposed to be to relieve you of the cleaning job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That was supposed to be to help me out with the cleaning
job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was Larry supposed to do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Whenever he got up or whenever he had time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Usually, what did he do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Usually he read books.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I mean, is, when you got there at your usual time, had
he begun to clean up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Usually he had begun to clean up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He hadn’t finished though?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Wasn’t it your custom, or duty to wake him up every morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t call him every morning to wake him up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No. If he was asleep I didn’t even bother him. Usually he
was awake, but there was sometimes that he was asleep and I didn’t bother
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he get paid?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see him take any money out of the cash register?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I had given him money out of the cash register.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Oh, a few bucks to eat off of. If he asked me for a couple
of dollars, I would give it to him and let him sign a slip for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that authorized by Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He had told you to do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He told me to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had he given you any limit as to how much it would be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; he hadn’t given me any limit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What would you do, make a slip to record it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Make a slip to record it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it amounted to what—to $2 or $3 a day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Something like that from $2 to $3—a couple of bucks a day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never gave him a regular salary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I didn’t myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But what you know about it is—it never was over $2 or $3 a
day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he stay around the club at night when the shows were on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He stayed there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was he supposed to do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Go to sleep if he wanted to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he take part in any of the operation of the club? Like
handling the lights, for example?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He did handle the lights some. I tried to teach him how
to work the lights, but he never did learn too well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he do any other things around the club at night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No more than clean up, and that’s all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he eat there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He usually went out to eat—there was no food there. Well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
he did—I’ll take it back—Jack did bring him some eggs and things for him
to fix his breakfast if he wanted to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there a stove to do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you notice whether he did cook there much?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. About twice I noticed that he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Other than that he didn’t cook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, from the time you got there say, around midday until you
left at 1 o’clock in the morning, the next morning, would you say that Larry
was there most of the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He was there most of the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you get to be friendly with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Friendly—well, not exactly. Friendly, <span class="locked">but——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You got along all right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. We got along all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There was no friction between you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As I understand it, most of the time when you got there he
had already been awake and at least begun to clean up, although most of
the time he had not finished and you and he finished together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, in a sense, he was helping you out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you got to the club about 11:20 and you heard the sirens
blowing and you turned on your transistor radio and you heard about the
President being shot, and I think you said you went and woke Larry up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I didn’t finish that. I woke Larry up and I—he sat
up and I went back out of the room and I went back to what I was doing because
it was necessary—absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean you were on the toilet, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; and then I heard further reports and I got up again
and I went and told Larry the President had been shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The first time you went there you didn’t tell him about the
President being shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I told him somebody shot at the President, and Larry—I
noticed the couple of times that I had woke him up he always went back to
sleep and he did the same thing this time, but when I told him that the President
had been shot, he jumped straight up—he got up immediately and put his
clothes on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what interval of time elapsed between the first time you
woke him up and then went back to the toilet and the second time when you
came back and told him the President had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I don’t know, it couldn’t have been longer than a couple of
minutes—I don’t think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. What did you all do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. We just walked around and listened to the radio, shaking
our heads and waiting on more reports.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have a television in the place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; we had a television—I turned the television on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you all listen to both the television and the radio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Both the television and the radio—there wasn’t too much
on the TV, so you could get more on the radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you hear from Jack, after the shooting of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Oh, I would say about 15 or 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After you first heard about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. After I first heard about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you hear from him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. On the telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He just said, “Did you hear?” and I said, “Yes.” He said,
“Ain’t it terrible?” “It’s a shame.” Just like that—real sadlike.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was before the President had died?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That was before the President had died.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know where he was calling from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I assumed he was calling from the Morning News.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why do you assume that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Because I could always tell when he called from the Morning
News.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why—because of what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, usually on Saturday at the time he was at the Morning
News—that was on a Saturday, wasn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; it was on Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It was on Friday—well, Friday or Saturday is the same as—the
Saturday <span class="locked">ads——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, is it your testimony then that he was usually at the Morning
News on both Friday and Saturday attending to the ads for the week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there any other thing that would make you believe he was
there at the Morning News, such as some background noises that would be
peculiar to a newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well—there was this typewriter that I always hear when
he called from down there, and I only heard it at this time—about four clicks
of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean on the time he called you about 20 minutes after the
President had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You heard four clicks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. On the typewriter that I usually hear it on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Usually, you would hear a big clatter of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At this time you heard about four clicks and no more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. And no more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you place any particular significance to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I was curious why you mentioned that fact then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I mentioned it to verify the reason why I thought he was
at the Morning News. He did not tell me he was at the Morning News.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. But I assumed that he was at the Morning News.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, he asked you if you had heard and you told him yes and
he said, “Wasn’t it terrible,” and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What else did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he said if anything happens we are going to close the
club up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. “If anything happens,” I suppose you mean that he was inferring,
or you thought he was, that if the President would die?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say so in so many words?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He just said, “If anything happens.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. “We are going to close the club.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any other conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; he said, “I’ll see you in about 30 minutes,” and I would
say he was there in about 5 minutes after they announced that the President was
dead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember what time that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I don’t recall what time it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case, within 5 minutes after you heard that the President
was dead, Jack came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he know then that the President was dead?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He knew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he was—he didn’t say anything—he just got on the
telephone. No, he said something about, “It’s a shame.” He kept saying, “It’s a
shame,” like that and he got on the telephone and he was crying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know who he was speaking to on the telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he spoke to his sister, he spoke to—he made some long-distance
phone calls, I think one to his brother Earl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He made one because it was—I could tell—I could usually
tell when he was usually talking to his brother Earl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he speak to Earl very often?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, during that month of November he had spoken to him
quite often about some business deal he was trying to get him to go into.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know the nature of that business deal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Twist boards, I think it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You overheard the conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, on this particular day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No, I mean on the previous occasions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, some of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you gather from what you heard Ruby say on the Dallas end
of the line when he was talking to his brother Earl that he was trying to interest
him in investing in the twist board invention?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, no—not on this day. On the other days—he didn’t say
anything about the twist board this day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand, I’m talking about the other day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, usually, I knew he was going to talk to him, he would
say, “I’m going to call Earl,” and he would ask for Earl’s phone number which
was on a pad there by the phone. He would ask me or he would get it himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was this twist-board business about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It was trying to promote a twist board, trying to get it to go
over like the hula hula or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know if he was trying to interest anyone else in that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I know he sent some brochures and things like that to other
people, but I don’t recall who.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From what you were able to hear during those various conversations
between Jack and Earl Ruby, during the month of November, was Earl
interested?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, yes and no. You could say he was interested in—for
hoping it would be a good deal for Jack’s benefit, but I don’t think he was too
interested in investing any money but if he would have to, I believe he would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack tell you all that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. In a way he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you mean “in a way”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, in other words, he said that Earl might invest money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, your statement about whether Earl was interested or not is
based upon two factors, I suppose, and correct me if I am wrong—was—one is
that you could hear Jack’s end of the conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the other is that Ruby told you some things about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the net result was that Earl wasn’t too interested in it, but
might be for Jack’s sake?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that a fair statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who else did Jack call, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he called Ralph Paul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you overhear that conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I remember it was a short conversation but Jack said he was
going to close the club up and Ralph said he was not going to close this
place <span class="locked">up——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know he said that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Because he told me later on he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, at the moment all you could hear was Jack saying to Ralph
Paul—he was going to close the place up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Jack did say—he says, “You should close yours up too.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you didn’t hear Paul’s answer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I didn’t hear his answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But later you understand from Paul that he told Jack he wasn’t
going to do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who else did he call; do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I don’t remember who else he called—he made five or
six phone calls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you say he was <span class="locked">crying——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. At two or three stages he was crying there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean when speaking to people or otherwise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. When using the phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Only when speaking to people or when he was not speaking to
people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he cried when he was speaking to me, after he had got
off the phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you crying, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack indicate why he was crying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say anything about how the death of the President would
affect the business community of Dallas, and particularly the convention business
here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I’m the one that mentioned it first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I said, “This will kill the business, conventionwise, and
things probably will slow up quite a bit—drop off quite a bit.” He said, “Yes;
you’ve got a point.” He said, “I think it will, too.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He wasn’t angry at you for making that suggestion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He agreed with you, in fact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He agreed with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did he stay from the time he first came in, which you
say was 5 minutes after you knew—after it had been announced that the
President had been killed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I would say he stayed there an hour; approximately an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And most of the time, you think, he was on the phone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Most of the time on the phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he get any calls from anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; he got some; the phone rang a couple of times, and also
the pay phone rang a couple of times; some of the girls called him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you answer it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I answered the pay phone and he answered the business
phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what did you all tell the girls; what were they asking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, they were just asking, “Did you hear the news?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell them then that the clubs would be closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, can you fix about what time Jack left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I can’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You said it was about 1 hour after you heard of the death of the
President, or 1 hour and 5 minutes, and if you think that estimate is wrong,
say so—I mean anybody can be wrong in an estimate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; that’s about right. He came in about 5 minutes after
they announced the death of the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he stayed about an hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. And he stayed about an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And made these various calls and then left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right. Now, what time was the death of the President; do
you have that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, suppose we assume it was approximately 1:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You would think, then, if that is so, he left about 2:35 p.m.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Prior to his leaving, then, did he give you any instructions or
tell you what to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He said that the club was going to be closed until Monday
and not to mention it to anybody connected with the other clubs because he,
himself, was pretty sure that they wouldn’t close up; his competitors didn’t get
along—they didn’t get along.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you why Monday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Why Monday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; he didn’t tell me why Monday. He just said that the club
would be closed and for me to call everyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he mention Monday that it would be closed Friday night,
Saturday night, and Sunday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He said the club would be closed Friday and Saturday and
Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say why he was picking those 3 days?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; he didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What other instructions did he give you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about notifying the girls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I notified them; yes; he gave me the instructions to
notify them—all the acts and the waitresses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you call Little Lynn—I think her name is Karen Bennett
Carlin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; she came down that night, I’m pretty sure. I think
I couldn’t get a’hold of her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you try to call her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I tried.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you didn’t reach her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I didn’t reach her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you say she came down that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That Friday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I think, and Friday night the club was closed and she went
back home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you don’t know that of your own knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; not to my own knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you are positive that you did not reach Karen—Little
Lynn—Bennett to call her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Sure I didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know her husband, Bruce, at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; he was up to the club quite often <span class="locked">until——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Until what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He was up to the club quite often after the assassination
until I suggested that he didn’t come around too often because of some business
there; Little Lynn was always getting into something with the other girls,
and she got him there to take up for her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This occurred after the assassination when you were managing
the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he was coming around, and you suggested not to come
around any more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Isn’t it a fact that that had happened before the assassination,
also, and that Jack told him so, or the same thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I’m sure—I’m not sure that Jack had told him, but I believe
that Jack had told him, because he was coming there and he stopped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, during the time that Jack came in at about 1:30 or
so and stayed until about 2:30 or 2:35 or 2:40, was this man Larry Crafard
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was with you at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Ruby come back that day, or did you hear from him any
more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He came back that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No—when he came back I was gone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, what time did you leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I left—I must have left about 4:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do in the interval between the time when Jack
left and the time you left, which was about 2 hours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Wait a minute here: let’s see; let me straighten a little something
out here because I am a little wrong here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; that’s what I want you to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I called the people—I called everybody and told them we
would be closed that night, Friday night, and Saturday—I called them we would
be closed Saturday and Sunday. In other words, Jack said we would be closed
tonight, possibly until Monday; in other words, Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Now, when I came down <span class="locked">Saturday——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, let’s not get to Saturday yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. OK; I will straighten that out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I want to get to that, but right now you want to change your
testimony because your best recollection right now is to the effect that on Friday
when you were talking with Jack it had not been decided how long the club
would be closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But only it would be closed Friday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Friday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It might be closed the other nights, but no decision was made
yet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s your best recollection of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s the best recollection of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us just for the record as to why you got confused;
have you any notion as to what made you get confused?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I was getting confused on account of the dates. In
other words, I was thinking that I didn’t—that the next time I would be at the
club would be Sunday, after I hear about the slaying of Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; I was thinking that would be my next appearance at
the club. In other words, I am trying to think ahead, but then my next appearance
at the club was Saturday, which I talked with Jack, because I recall
Jack fired me that Saturday, but we’ll get to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, we will get to that, but we want to keep the dates straight
too, if we can, and the times, but let me say this to you: If you do make a mistake
in time or date, please feel completely free to come back and correct it, because
what we are looking for is the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s the reason I’m not giving you any definite time,
because like when I had my interview with Mr. Peggs, definitely—any definite
time, and that was right after the assassination—just a few days after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Anyway, the way we have left it is that you left at
approximately 4:30, having called the girls and told them that the club would
be closed that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. And I reached Little Lynn that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did reach Little Lynn that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That day, but the next Saturday, I didn’t; the Saturday, I
didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you did call Little Lynn in Fort Worth; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And told her that the club would be closed Friday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And told her that—what did you tell her with reference to
Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I said that we would be closed tonight, and I didn’t say
anything other than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, about 4:30 you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To go home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I go home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear from Ruby any more that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I didn’t hear from him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was Larry Crafard at the club when you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He was there when I left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see him again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the nature of the conversation between you and Larry
after Ruby left about 2:30 on that Friday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. After he left about 2:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; you said you and Larry were there between 2:30 and 4:30
when you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. You see, Jack left and Larry was walking up and down the
aisle there shaking his head and—well, he was doing nothing—I would just try
to get up and try to finish cleaning up, which I did, and it didn’t take too much
because we had gone through the procedure of cleaning up while we was listening
to the news, and that was from a Thursday night and we don’t have that
many people in there on Thursday night—Thursday night and Sunday night
are bad nights.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you and Larry talk after Ruby left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I imagine we said a few words to each other; Larry went
out and ate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. While you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did he stay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Oh, he stayed about 20 minutes, I guess, and when he got
back Jack came back in about 10 minutes later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were still there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Pardon; I was still there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I thought you told me that you had not seen Jack any more
that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I’m still thinking that—I’m still thinking when I had
not seen Jack on Friday—when I left, I left Jack and Larry in the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, we have to revise this, because I want you to get your
best recollection in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. You see, this is the reason why I know; I had some boards
and some bricks to carry home, and I made a phone call to a brick company
over on McKinney and told the fellow if he would bring my bricks over to my
house—he said, “Yes”—it was 25 bricks, these boards and bricks for me to build
a corner shelf, and I had painted the boards in the club and I remember Jack
asked me what was I going to do with those boards and I told him the layout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
of what I had planned on and he said it was very nice, and I wrapped them
in newspaper and I left the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was at 4:30; is that the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That was about 4:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, let’s get it straight; Jack left about an hour and 5 minutes
after the time he first came in; right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you left about 2 hours after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you left approximately, as we have reconstructed it as we
went along, about 4:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you said that Jack came in again before you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Before I left; just a little before I left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which would have been about 4 you think, or 4:15?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what was his condition at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Still in the same—he wasn’t crying any more, but he was
still sad and speaking about the assassination and things of that nature and
saying a few other things about the club and asked me had I contacted everyone,
and I told him, “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What other things about the club was he talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Oh, just about—there was certain things to cut out and certain
lights to cut off and was the box unplugged; the things that I always
take care of: he always asked about it later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there any phone calls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I don’t recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At that time, during the second visit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I don’t recall any more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear him talking to Larry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; he did ask Larry about a certain phone number, someone’s
phone number that he had Larry to put down in a book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember whose phone number that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, I sure don’t—it was a business phone number—some
business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he make a call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I don’t remember him making a call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I think it was the people that printed up the stationery—I’m
not sure, but I think that’s who he was calling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t hear that call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when you left it was about 4:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you left Ruby and Larry at the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you went home and went to bed—on about your business
and didn’t hear from Jack until the next day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As I understand it, you never saw Larry afterward?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right. He left a key at the garage downstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you first find out about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. About <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About the key and Larry leaving it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Oh, about 1 o’clock, I guess, I got down again about 1 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. On Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I always stopped at the garage to see if there was any mail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that where the mail was delivered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s where the mail was delivered and Ben gave me the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
key. He said Larry had left it and left a note and just said thank Jack for
everything, and that’s all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean a written note?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, Ben, the man at the garage, told you that Larry
had left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you what time he left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He said “Early this morning,” that’s all he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He didn’t give you any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he said that he had left the key and a written note?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Saying to thank Jack for everything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That he was leaving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was the written note?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. With the key—just a little piece of paper—I think it was
an envelope tore up or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do with it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I don’t know—I guess I must have throwed it away
because only thing on it was “Thank Jack.” I read it to Jack on the phone
and I guess I must have throwed it in the trash by the phone there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And when you got upstairs, did you call Jack as usual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was at his house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That would have been about 1 or a little after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. About 10 after, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you find him then, his attitude, and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He said when I told him about Larry, he said, “I guess he
wanted to be with his people through all this.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He wanted to be through with what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He said, “I guess he wanted to be with his people through
this,”—you know—through the assassination. So, we didn’t say anything else—he
didn’t say anything else except he said, “I’ll see you later.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say you read him the note?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he told you to throw it away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, he didn’t tell me to throw it away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you did do it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As far as you know, the note is not in existence right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. As far as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You actually looked at it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you read it in fact to Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Give us your best recollection of precisely what the note said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It just said, “Thanks, Jack, for everything.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did it have a signature on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it in his handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, it was in his handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You recognized his handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know where Larry’s people were at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack know?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; he didn’t know either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You found out later, I think?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, there was a letter that he had received, which—pardon
me—someone got it in this letter that I have the letter in my possession.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I don’t have it, but the last I saw of the letter was when I
showed it to one of the FBI men at the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was a letter received by Jack? Or written by Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; a letter written to Larry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To Larry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. From some girl in some other city.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Did you send me this [presenting witness’ letter of notice to
depose to Counsel Hubert]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, you remember what city it was sent from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, isn’t it a fact that you forwarded two letters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. One that Larry was writing himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; to a girl called Gayle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right, and one that he had received from her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that letter opened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It was opened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But it was still in the envelope?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you just gave that to the FBI people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you find it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. In Larry’s belongings there in his room on a little table there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he leave any belongings behind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He left some shirts, he left a pair of khakies, I think, or
bluejeans—a pair of jeans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have any bags up in that room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He had one little bag, a sort of a little square bag with a
little handle or two little handles like that [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By the measurements you are making, it is a bag about 12 to 15
inches in length?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And about 6 or 8 inches in height?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. About big enough to get a change of clothes in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He didn’t have another bag, did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was this bag you are talking about made of leather or cloth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It was made of leather.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And all he left behind was just this one change of clothing and two
letters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, you see, Jack had bought him a change of clothes, you
see. Jack bought him a suit. I think he left what he had—his change of clothing,
and carried the suit with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you find these two letters, one written to him and one
written by him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. In the room where he slept on a table there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They wasn’t in the wastepaper basket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you pick those things up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. When the FBI’s were there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Not before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you didn’t pick them up on Saturday at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No—I didn’t even go in that room on Saturday. As a matter
of fact, I didn’t even know he had anything there—they were looking for something
with his handwriting on it, for something possibly where he had gone and
we started searching where he was staying and we found those letters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was on the first day you spoke to the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; this was not on the first day. We opened back up on a
Monday, I think we spoke to the FBI—one FBI that Monday, but later on, you
know, there was some other ones—possibly the last part of the week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it was then that they were talking to you at the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And they asked about Larry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you all went and searched his room where he had been and
they found the letters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are sure that that’s right, Mr. Armstrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I looked in the room myself. They was in the office,
which has a door from his room to the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you look in his room either on Saturday or Sunday, the 23d
or 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And when you looked in his room, it was when the FBI was interviewing
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; I didn’t even know Larry had left any belongings there
until the FBI was asking me about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you went into the room alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, the door was open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then you came out and you showed them these things?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what date that was on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, I sure don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, as I understand it, a little after 1 on Saturday the
23d, you spoke to Ruby over the phone and told him about Larry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, did any other conversation take place between you on
that telephone call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. None?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you what to do with reference to the club on Saturday
night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say that he would be there soon or something of that
sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He said he would be there sometime “this afternoon.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you stay there until he came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, I was there when he came.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did he come?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I don’t recall the exact time—I don’t think that Jack came
in the club that day before—it was late in the afternoon—I don’t know the
exact time, but it was somewhere around 6 or 7 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it still daylight or dark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It was still daylight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there any phone calls during the time you talked to Ruby
on the phone until he came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, there was phone calls—something about was we going
to be open—a few reservations came in, and I told them I didn’t know whether
we would be open tonight or not and to call back later, and there was a couple
of girls called.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you tell them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. The girls was told, “I’ll talk to you later.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, Jack came in at approximately 6 o’clock, or at least before
dark—but it was getting dark, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Describe his condition at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he was still in a sad mood, you know, in a sorrowful
mood, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he crying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, he wasn’t crying this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were in a sorrowful mood, too, I take it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you say that his mood and yours were about the same?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No—my sorrowful mood was sort of on the inside mostly, and
his was in his face and in the way he was worried about the things. He seemed
like—to be more worried than ever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, how—that is to say—what was he doing that gave you
the impression that he was more worried than ever? You have told us he
had a sad look on his face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he was—he just felt like—it seemed like he was just
disturbed over what had happened, you know, over the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, of course, you are telling us about the mental impression
you formed, which is perfectly all right, but it would be helpful to us if you
could give us facts upon which you base your opinion, you see? Now, you
have given us one fact—he had a sad look on his face. If you could tell us
the things that he said or did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I don’t recall anything that he said that day, no more than—he
said the club was going to be closed and immediately I got on the phone
and started to making phone calls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To all the people who were concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right, to all the people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the object was to tell them not to come in that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes—I know now—and it was around 6 o’clock, because one
of the girls was getting ready to come down to town, one of the waitresses.
They had to be there at 7:30, so it was around 6:30—between 6 and 6:30 when
I was making the phone calls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you said you tried to call Karen Bennett Carlin then,
but you couldn’t reach her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Couldn’t reach her, and I believe Jack said, “I will call her
later.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean he undertook to call her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He told me to keep trying and he would try to call her, too, and
he left and went home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did he leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He left about 7 o’clock, between 7 and 7:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, he was there roughly between an hour and an hour and a
half?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were making all these phone calls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, and he asked me to stay there until about 8 o’clock, just
in case any customers called and if they did, to tell them we would be closed
until Monday, and he called me back and he said, “What time are you leaving?”
I said, “Well, 8 o’clock, I want to go home.” He said, “Well, will you stay on
to 10?” I said, “What should I stay here until 10 o’clock for?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was he calling from, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He was calling from home, I’m pretty sure it was from home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What gives you that impression?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, because he had said, “If anything come up, call me.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To call him at home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He just said, “Call me,” so—he always just said, “Call me”
when he was at home and if he was not at home, he would always give me a
number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, when he said, “If anything happens, call me,” you
knew that that meant he was at home, because that was the custom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right, and so we got into a discussion of whether I should
stay there until 10 o’clock or should I leave at 8 o’clock, and I said, “Well, I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
leaving at 8 o’clock,” and he said, “Well, just get on out of the club and don’t
come back no more.” And slammed the phone down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was about a half hour after he left, wasn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right, but I stayed there until 8 o’clock, like I said I was
going to stay, and I closed the club up and went home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear from him any more that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, on Sunday, did you go to the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I had planned on going to the club—I was planning on
looking for another job Monday morning, because I said—“This is it.” I had
already made up my mind then I wasn’t going back to work there, no matter
what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I just got fed up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But this had happened, I think you said, 35 times or so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What you mean to say is that the last time is the straw that
broke the camel’s back sort of thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you had definitely made up your mind that this time you
weren’t going back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that this time you were going to start looking for a job on
Monday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go to the club on Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, after I heard about it—well, I was listening to the radio
that morning—I was not looking at television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were home then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right; it was Sunday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. When I heard about the shooting of Oswald and they said
it was a well-known nightclub owner, and so I got a phone call—no, then, it
come on the radio that it was Jack Ruby and I got a phone call is when I found
out it was on television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who called you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. A friend of mine—William Morris. He used to help me
down at the club some Saturday nights when we had a big convention in—he
would come down and help me out at the bar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then what—he called you and told you it was Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I knowed it was Ruby—they said that on the radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, Morris called you and told you it was on television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He said, “Did you see it on television?” And I said, “No;
I didn’t see it on television.” He said, “Well, turn the television on.” And
so I turned the television on and they rerun the shooting, and what I saw on
the TV was a rerun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. And so—about—sometime during that day, I forget what
time it was, I called Ralph Paul.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time was it actually, and where was it from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. From home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s a long-distance call, wasn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, there would be a record of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right, and he <span class="locked">said——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s do it this way—can you tell us how long after you saw
the rerun that you called Paul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I don’t know whether it was before I went down to the
club or after I went down to the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You said you had called from your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes—you see, when I went down to the club I wasn’t gone but
an hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you go down to the club for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I went down and fed the dogs, because I knew that they
would be down there all day long without any food, and Clipper, I was crazy
about and I didn’t want him going hungry—that was the only two dogs
there, so I fed the dogs—went down and fed the dogs and there was a newsman
in front of the club and he tried to grab me when I came out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The police did too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; just the newsman, but I didn’t give him any statement
or anything. I had called a friend of mine to bring me downtown and I went
and got in the car and went on back home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you are not sure whether you called Paul from the club or
from the house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I know I called him from home, but I don’t know if it
was before or after—it was around 12 o’clock, I imagine, when I got downtown—somewhere
along in there, but when I did call Ralph, I said, “What are you
going to do, open the club up?” He said, “Meet me down there Monday,” and
I did meet him down at the club Monday and decided to keep the club open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any conversations with anyone else during the
course of Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you interviewed by the FBI Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were not interviewed until Monday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not until Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where were you when they interviewed you then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. At the club—Monday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The club was open then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were managing it for Ralph Paul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I wasn’t managing it—he managed it himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You met him there Monday—Paul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it during the daytime?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It was during the daytime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He decided to keep on running it and asked you if you would
just keep on with it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes—oh, yes; I did call Eva Grant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Mrs. Grant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What day was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. On Sunday—no, no—on Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not speak to her on Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I called her on Monday and told her Jack had fired me—this
was Monday morning. She said, “Well, nonsense, you know how Jack is.
Go on down to the club. Mr. Ralph said he would meet me down there.” And
she said, “You know how my brother is, he was disturbed, he didn’t know what
he was doing anyway.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Paul had just simply told you to meet him at the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He didn’t know anything about the firing, but I told him at
the club—Monday. Now, when I told him, he said, “How many times does that
make?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who said that—Ralph Paul said that to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; I said, “I don’t know, about a hundred, I guess.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did the club continue to operate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It continued to operate until February, I think it was, the
last of February—the last Friday in February.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who decided to close it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. The vice squad decided to close it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. For what reason?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I mean, the Liquor Control Board.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Because the license hadn’t been paid?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Because the license was in Jack’s name and it was obvious
he had violated those liquor licenses when he shot Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you ever seen anybody at the club that looked like Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you seen Oswald himself in the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever tell anybody that you had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Specifically, did you ever tell Larry Crafard that you had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Billy DeMar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He was an M.C.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He also had a memory act, didn’t he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have heard the story, haven’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; I have heard the story.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That he said he had seen Oswald in the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s what he told me—he said he thought that he saw somebody
that could have been Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did he tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That was later—he said—he was walking around every night
saying that the newspaper misunderstood what he had said. He said he definitely
did not state the statement that they had in the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think it is possible that you told Larry Crafard that you
had seen him, that you thought you had seen somebody that looked like Oswald
in the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, it isn’t possible—no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We have been going for 3 hours, and let’s adjourn for lunch.</p>

<p>(At this point the proceedings in the deposition of Andrew Armstrong were
recessed for lunch and resumed at 1:35 p.m. on the same date, April 14, 1964, as
follows:)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Armstrong, you understand that we are continuing the deposition
which we started this morning, and which we adjourned at about noon,
and you understand that we are continuing it under the same oath and conditions
upon which it was begun. You understand further that you are under the
same oath you took this morning at the very beginning of the deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you consider yourself to be under that same oath?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me clarify one point before I go further—with reference to
the gun or pistol that you have already testified about, can you give us a description
of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Let’s see—it was not a large gun, a small barrel on it, I guess
you would call it a snub nose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I notice you were holding your fingers apart there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And would you say you were holding them about 5 inches apart?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. About 5 inches, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that’s the whole length of the gun from one tip to the other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; I would say so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it a revolver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; I think it was a revolver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember what kind of barrel it had on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, it had a little short barrel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But I mean, what color was it; black, blue, steel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, it was—I don’t remember—I only saw the gun, you
know, in sight—you know I saw the bag a jillion times, but the gun only a couple
of times, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What kind of handle did it have on it; do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I think it had a brown handle on it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Mr. Ruby have a holster for that gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I never saw it with one—I never saw a holster.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, by a holster, I am including both types of holsters, one that
is worn on the belt around the hip and one that is worn slung around the
shoulders and the gun is usually in the armpit, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never saw either type?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As a matter of fact, as I understood your testimony, you never
saw him actually carry it on his person at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Either in his pocket or stuck in his belt or otherwise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know whose gun that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I assumed it was his gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever hear any talk about whose gun it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; he asked me where is my gun—the few times he came
in and left it in the kitchen and asked me about it and I would say, “You left
it in the kitchen, or some place like that.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Turning to another subject—did you ever observe
any particular interest on the part of Ruby with reference to police or police
work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Any particular part or effort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any particular interest on his part in police or police work—generally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ever in your presence express any views toward the
police—good or bad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Oh, the only views he ever spoke was good views.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you give us an example?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Oh, just that he didn’t like to hear anyone knocking the
police department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever hear anyone knock the police department in his
presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, no, not direct—saying any bad things about the police
department, but someone might have made a statement about the police department
and he would not like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, are you drawing on your imagination for that, or do
you remember a specific instance in which he indicated that he did not like a
person speaking in a bad way about the police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I don’t remember—in my mind I was trying to remember—to
recall an incident, but I don’t remember an incident, but there was an
incident, I’m sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As I understand you, then, you definitely have the impression
that he did not like people talking badly about the police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t remember any specific instance which you can give
us as an example of how you formed that impression?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But the impression, nevertheless, is in your mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever heard him discuss politics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What opinion do you have concerning his interest in politics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. His interest was that—I have heard him say—I have heard
him say this, that anybody that was elected to hold a certain office must be
responsible and capable of taking care of that position or they wouldn’t be
elected.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, that is a specific instance that you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us when it was?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I don’t remember when it was, but I remember that
incident—I know who he was talking to—it was just a conversation and I
happened to be there and to hear this party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. His view, generally, then, was that an elected official should
be respected, is that the idea?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Because they had been elected by the people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever hear him discuss the President of the United
States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I’m sure I have—everybody has, but I don’t know of what
nature or what subject, but I’m sure I heard him discuss the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, of course, you know that in this country as perhaps all
over the world there are different views about government, and society normally
called “isms” left or right or communisms or pro-Castro or anti-Castro
or things of that sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever heard Ruby express himself in areas of thought
such as those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I know he threw a guy out of the club once for speaking
as a Communist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you tell us about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, it was just that this guy was heckling with the MC,
Wally Weston, and he was coming on like he was a large portion of the Communist
Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This man was—this patron?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; and Wally stepped off of the stage—he made a remark
<span class="locked">that——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say “he” do you mean Wally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; the customer made a remark that Wally could be—made
a remark something similar to Wally could be a Communist or something
like that too, in other words, “How do I know, you may be a Communist, too,”
or something like that. And, Wally stepped off of the stage and said, “Don’t
you call me a Communist,” and he hit the guy and by the time he hit him Jack
had him and was rushing him out the door, and told him, “Never come back
in this club no more.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he push him out of the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He pushed him out of the door—he pushed him up against
the wall and told him to go out the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He didn’t hit him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; he didn’t hit him—Wally hit him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And Jack hustled him out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. When you go out the door, you are going to face a wall—in
other words, the stairways come up like this [indicating], and the door is
here and you’ve got to turn and go down the stairway and he shoved the guy
right on into the wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then he walked down the stairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Then he hurried down the stairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was this incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It was—I would say around the last of September or somewhere
along in there or October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What makes you fix the date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, it was toward the last part of the summer, I’m sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This man had been in the audience boasting, you say, that he
was a big shot Communist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, not a big shot, but he come on like he was a big portion
of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What sort of looking man was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He was a young fellow with two other young couples from
Arlington State College—I think that’s where he said he was from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, that’s what they said—that’s what they had said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
Wally had asked them where they was from and he said he was a student at
Arlington—I’m sure they said Arlington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. At Arlington College.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At Arlington State College?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where is that located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. In Arlington, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you say there were two couples?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; there were two men and a lady.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it was one of the men who was going on like he was a big
Communist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The other man and the lady were quiet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. They were quiet and never said a thing and they apologized
for his behavior after Jack had put this other guy out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they stay on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; they said—Wally said, “Are you going to follow your
friend?” And they said, “No; we couldn’t say he was a friend of ours, and we
just happened to be together.” And then he dropped out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How was this man dressed, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he had a suit on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old a man was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Oh, about 21 or 22, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How tall was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. About 5 feet 9, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What would be your estimate of his weight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not much over 150 or 160.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have a tie on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; he had a tie on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have a mustache?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No mustache.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What color was his hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I think he had dark—I don’t know whether it was black or
dark brown, but it was dark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I would like, if you could, for you to fix the time of that incident
a bit closer than you have been able to do it so far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, no; I couldn’t—the air conditioners were running.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The air conditioners were running?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. And it was around the last of August—it wasn’t too—well,
if you could ask Wally he probably could give you a better date than I could when
it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t remember the night of the week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I sure don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would it be helpful if you tried to estimate how long before the
assassination of the President this all happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was Crafard there then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; he came after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was before Crafard came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About how long was it before Crafard came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I don’t know—well—it was sometime during the summer</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you talk to Ruby about it afterwards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear Ruby say anything about it afterwards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; Wally and I discussed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the nature of that discussion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I was teasing him about his right hook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. His what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. His right hook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean he hit the guy pretty good?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. You see, Wally split his hand open and I got some band-aids
and bandaged it up a little bit and helped him clean it off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where is Wally Weston now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Where is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I don’t know—he was working at the Club Montemarte, but
he’s not there any more and I’m sure he’s not in town now, so he’s probably
on the road some place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember any other people who were there that night,
such as George Senator or Ralph Paul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; things like that I don’t try to remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did Weston leave, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Oh, let’s see, Wally left in September, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how long had he been there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He had been there since about June 1961—no, 1962, I’m
sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was there about 15 months, but you thought that it was in
the last month that he was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; somewhere right around the last few months he was
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, if he left in September—you thought earlier than that—it
might be, this incident might have occurred in August, if that’s the case, it
wouldn’t be then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, when he left there—he still had that scar—it was still
sort of open a little bit on his hand, and it hadn’t been healed up—well, it had
healed, but it was such a big gash and you could still see the print where they
took the stitches out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have to go to the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He had some stitches taken in his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us anything from your own knowledge, that is having
heard or seen things at the club, which would throw light upon Ruby’s attitude
toward the race question, the Jewish question, and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you ever heard him fussing with his entertainers who cracked
jokes about Jews?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he didn’t like for the entertainers to crack any jokes
about Jews or to tell any Jewish stories.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he told me himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us what he told you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, you see, Wally and some of the other M.C.’s have some
pretty good jokes about Negroes and Jack told me <span class="locked">once——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Jack asked me once—did Wally’s jokes offend men in any
kind of way, and I told him “no”. So, he said—well, there was something
about it he didn’t like—the reason why he didn’t like his M.C.’s to tell any
Jewish jokes was something about the Jews have already had enough problems
and enough troubles already or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he sensitive about being a Jew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I don’t think so—I wouldn’t say that he was proud
of being a Jew, I wouldn’t say he was not proud, because I don’t know. He
never showed anything to give me any kind of reason to form an opinion about
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When Larry Crafard left and you found out about it, what
was your reaction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I didn’t have any reaction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you think about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Nothing; just plumb nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, weren’t you surprised that this man should go off like
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why not—it was rather strange conduct just to pick up and
leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I didn’t give it any thought—he left the way he came.
He came unexpectedly and he left unexpectedly. It didn’t bother me one bit
whether he stayed or whether he left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you, prior to the shooting of Oswald, give any thought to
the possibility that maybe this man Crafard was getting out of town for
some reason?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know how he was getting out of town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I didn’t—I didn’t know how he was leaving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever found out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I didn’t ask him when I saw him at the trial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us about what conversation you—there was between you
and Crafard at the trial of Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No conversation at all. He did most of the talking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us what he said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he didn’t say anything, but he said something about—he
was surprised when he heard about Jack—the shooting of Oswald, and
Jack, and that the FBI had contacted him, and I just told him that I had
found the letter from this girl Gayle and had given it to the FBI and that
was about all there was—that was about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you where he had been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; he didn’t tell me where he had been. He said he had
a job in some kind of mine somewhere up in Missouri or wherever he was,
and he left there to come back here to the trial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He told you that he had come to Dallas for the purpose of
attending the trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; for the purpose of testifying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember where it was you spoke to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. In the county courthouse downtown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean just in the hallway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Downstairs—just as you come in the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You only had one conversation with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; that afternoon I was on my way back after recess and
he was on one side of the street and I was on the other side of the street and
he saw me and he came across the street and he said, “You remember this
suit?” It was the suit that Jack bought him, and I said, “Yes.” And he said,
“This is all I’ve got—that Jack bought it for me.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that the only other time you spoke to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s the only time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did the conversation last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not longer than a few minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, after Ruby shot Oswald, did you give any thought to the
possibility that Crafard’s sudden departure the way he went might be linked up
with the shooting of Oswald by Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never have given any thought to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, no; not at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Prior to the shooting of Oswald, and now that you look back
on it, can you tell us anything that indicated that he might have been thinking
of doing it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That Jack might have been thinking of doing it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You understand I don’t mean that you knew prior to the shooting
that he was going to do it, but now that you look back on those days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I know what you mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there anything that you can remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That might throw some light on what he was thinking about
in that regard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I don’t believe he was thinking about it until after he
did it. The reason why I say that, because you’ve got to know Jack—he always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
did things on the spur of the moment, you know. He always blowed up just
like that [snapping his fingers], if something disturbed him, he would always
just crack up. He was charming one minute and the next minute he was
all riled up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you interviewed by the Dallas police concerning this
matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Never?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you interviewed by the district attorney?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or any of his staff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you interviewed by Jack Ruby’s attorneys?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were subpenaed to go to the trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I was subpenaed to go to the trial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did anyone ever talk to you about the nature of the testimony
you were expected to give?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; the only someone I talked to is Belli. He came up to
the club the first night, the second day he was in town, and he asked me what
did I think of Jack Ruby, when I was letting him in the office, he hadn’t gotten
in the office good before he asked me that, and I told him, and he said “Okay,”
and nobody ever talked to me since then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you tell him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. The same thing I told you—about him cracking up—he just—everything
he did, he did it on impulse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ask you about that or did you volunteer that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; he asked me—he just popped up and asked me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he pop up and ask you, “What do you think about Jack
Ruby?” Or, did he ask you “Does he pop up and flare up suddenly?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; here’s the exact words he asked me, “Why do you think
Jack shot Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what did you tell him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Just that he did it on an impulse, is the only reason at all—just
cracked up and shot the man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But Ruby never carried a gun around on his person, did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He had a gun that day with him, though? Would that influence
your thinking somewhat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And from what I understand of your previous testimony, the
that fact that he would have a gun on him would be unusual; wouldn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Coming in and out of the club, yes; but I don’t know whether
he carried it on him or not when he was not coming in and out of the club.
In other words, I was stating that if he did carry a gun—when I saw him with
a gun, it was always in a bag, never on him, but when he was away from the
club—I don’t know where he had this gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But your impression was that he didn’t carry it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Therefore, when you found that he did carry it on the day he
shot Oswald, didn’t that rather surprise you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, no; my wife asked me, “What was Jack doing with
a gun?” And I said, “I don’t know. He might have just had it in the car and
didn’t want to open the trunk because he had that money in there, probably, and
just stuck it in his pocket and wasn’t in his senses that he had been in all the
time.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your wife, in fact, was curious about the same things I’m asking
you about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why would she have been curious about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, it was because that she never knew that he carried one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
and she didn’t like guns, so when it come to the question of a gun, she, by being
a woman, and you know how women are about being curious, she asked the
question, but she asked a whole lot of other questions about things she never
knew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, your testimony is that when you found that Ruby had shot
Oswald, you were not surprised that he was carrying a gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I wasn’t surprised.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever talked to any members of Ruby’s family about
the man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. About the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; about Ruby’s case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; not other than Mrs. Grant called me and talked to me
and she would do most of the talking—this and that and it’s always about the
same thing and it just bugs me, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have only spoken to her by phone since Ruby shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I spoke to her in person. I have seen her at the club
a couple of times. She has been up there and I have seen her down at the
courthouse and I saw her a number of times up to the club after the club had
been closed, down at the club trying to sell it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she ever talk about the case itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; not to—not any more than any other sister would say
when her brother was being locked up or committed a crime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, when you were subpenaed, did you ever ask her or anybody
what they were calling you for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I didn’t ask anyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you just hung around the court during the entire time of
the trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not the entire time of the trial; the last week of the trial—Monday,
Tuesday, and Wednesday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Those were the only 3 days you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Just those 3 days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You received your subpena after the trial began?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you were there for 3 days?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Three days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The trial ended on Saturday, I think?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who excused you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Phil Burleson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He just said—I asked him the second day—I ask him, I said,
“Well, listen, when are you going to use me, because I’ve got a job and these
people are not going to hold off—they are going to hire somebody else.”</p>

<p>And he said, “We are going to put you on tomorrow, in fact we will get to
you tomorrow,” and Belli changed his mind about using me on account of the
record I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you find that out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Phil Burleson came out that afternoon and told me and
I kept asking him—no, that was after the judge had recessed for that day,
I asked him, I said, “Listen, I’ve got to go to work tomorrow,” and he says,
“Well, go ahead, Belli is not going to use you on account of your record,” and
so, to my surprise I lost my job by not being able to work those 3 days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who were you employed by then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I had just started with Yardell Construction Co.,
they build houses—homes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Other than the time you spoke to Belli at the club and he
asked you what you thought about Jack or why he killed him and you told
him, did you ever speak to Belli or anybody else about what your testimony
would be about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, that as far as you know, they were going to question you
about your opinion about Jack?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; that’s what I thought.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then, Burleson told you the reason they couldn’t use you
was because of your record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you seen pictures of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. In the paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I guess you saw pictures on TV and some of the famous pictures
that were published at the time he got shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does he bear any resemblance to that man that had the fight
with Wally Weston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; this gentleman that had the fight with Wally Weston
was sort of a young loudmouth, a smart alec—he had kind of a full face—a
handsome fellow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are willing to state that it was not the man whom you
have come to know through pictures as Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you would be positive about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You worked for a man by the name of Roland Davis one time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Roland Davis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; I think he was connected someway with the El Rancho
Hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Oh, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You worked there in 1961?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; that was right after I got out—I have forgotten about
that—right after I got back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What kind of work did you do there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I was a night clerk at the motel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who hired you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Mr. Davis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does Mr. Davis have other lines besides running the motel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not that I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he engaged in selling—in dealing with Jeeps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I never saw any Jeeps. The only cars I saw he would
own was a Cadillac and a station wagon that had “El Rancho” on the side of
his station wagon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know if Ruby was ever involved in trading in automobiles
with Jeeps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never heard that at all?</p>

<p>Air. Armstrong. He just could get a car, from what I gather.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He just could get a car from what I get.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I wasn’t thinking of his buying Jeeps for his own use,
but trading in them. That is to say, as a business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a Nancy Jo Mooney?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Nancy Jo Mooney; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, did you know one by the name of Betty MacDonald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever hear of a girl who had worked at the Carousel
as either a waitress or a stripper who committed suicide about the middle of
February of this year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By hanging herself in jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And she was arrested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have never heard anything about that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And any of those names—Betty MacDonald or Nancy Jo Mooney
mean nothing to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. There was a girl named Nancy who worked at the club for
a few nights or a few weeks—I don’t recall. There were so many girls came
there—some of them I don’t even remember their names, but I don’t know whether
it was Jo Mooney or what her last name was—as a matter of fact, I don’t
even recall how she looked, but I remember writing the name Nancy as a waitress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they have a Polaroid camera at the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was it used for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. To make pictures of the twisting, customers doing the twist
on the stage, which the M.C. would use to make a joke with them—and give the
customers the picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who operated that camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Larry Crafard do so also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. One Sunday night, I think he did—I remember showing
him how to operate it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were those the only pictures that were allowed to be taken in
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever hear of any other photographer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well—there <span class="locked">was——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who would come in and take pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, there was this magazine that came in to make some
shots, but they required—that was for the magazine article did on the Carousel
Club, which, anybody that appeared in the picture that was a customer signed a
release on that picture, or if they did not sign a release on the picture, it couldn’t
be used.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did that take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That took place sometime between the last of October and
the first of November. Larry was there—he came there the last of October—it
must have been the first of November.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Must have been around the first of November—did he stay just
1 night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, no; 1 week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the man’s name, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Offhand, I can’t recall his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was his name Rocco?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Rocco; that’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he took a series of pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He took a series of pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He stayed about a week and then left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But other than that, there were no pictures taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, no other pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Jimmy Rhodes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He’s a photographer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he come around?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he take pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Of the girls—usually at his studio. If he made any at the
club, it was not during business. It was all right for anybody—there was lots
of pictures made, you know, like during the day, if the girls wanted to come up
and pose for the photographers and things like that, that was okay, but when
I said no other pictures were made in the club, I was speaking of during business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, there was no commercial photographer there
who would take the pictures of the patrons and sell them to them; is that
right?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But anybody could take pictures if they wanted to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, if they come in after I get there in the daytime and tell
me they would be there to make pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean, during the shows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, no; anybody couldn’t take pictures, if we saw anyone
with a camera we would take it away from them—they had to check them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, it was prohibited to take pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. They was prohibited from taking pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And nobody you knew of could take pictures except Jimmy
Rhodes and Rocco and of course you, with your Polaroid?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right, but Jimmy Rhodes could not take pictures during
business. In other words, when we had customers in the house and there was a
show going on, no one could take any pictures but Rocco is the only one I know
that made pictures, besides myself, when there was a show going on and we
had customers in the club. I’m speaking of before this assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes. Did you know Officer Tippit, the man that was shot by
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know whether Jack Ruby knew him?</p>

<p>Mr Armstrong. He said that he knew Officer Tippit, but from what I gather
later on—Mrs. Grant told me it was a different Officer Tippit that he knew.
In other words, there was two officers that had the name of Tippit, from what
I gather, and Jack said when the news was coming over the radio about the
policeman being shot, that it was Officer Tippit; Jack jumped straight up and
said, “I know him—I know him.” Just like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was his reaction to the shooting of Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he said—he was in a sort of—he said, “Isn’t it a
shame?” You know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he seem to be as disturbed about the shooting of Tippit as
he was about the shooting of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he was already disturbed and he didn’t show to be
any more disturbed over that than he already were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know about a girl named Gloria?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. There was a girl named Gloria that worked up there—I
can’t recall how she looked, but I remember the name Gloria.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you remember her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. By the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was she doing in the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. She was a waitress—I don’t know whether she did any
dancing or not on the amateurs, but I know that there was a girl by the name
of Gloria.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was she with Ruby, did she date him, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not that I know of—it wasn’t one of the girls that I hired,
so he must have brought her in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did she stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, how many days?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I couldn’t say—a week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, a month—I don’t
know. It couldn’t have been over a month though, because the girls that
stayed there usually stayed there a month or 2 months—I usually remember
them quite well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Wasn’t there some girl that was going with Jack during the
last 2 or 3 days before the President was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember a girl by the name of Joyce Lee McDonald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What do you know about her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. She is a stripper. Her name is—her stage name is Joy Dale.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was she at the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. She was at the club.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. During what period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Oh, during the period of—I would say 2 months before
the assassination through the end of the year. She left about the third week
in January, I would say, approximately 3 weeks she worked during 1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She was a stripper, was she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. She was a stripper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have heard that Jack was supposed to have been in the
B &amp; B Cafe with some girl either before the President was shot, the night
before or the night after, haven’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, I heard that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As a matter of fact, I think you were asked about that by
the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I don’t know—I don’t know whether I was or not. Somebody
asked me about it—yes, I’m pretty sure it must have been the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Didn’t you identify the girl as being Joyce McDonald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, I don’t recall—no, I wouldn’t have—I wouldn’t have
identified the girl as being Joyce McDonald, because I wouldn’t have had any
way of knowing who it was unless they described her to me, and as I said,
it could have been Joyce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You remember a girl who worked about 5 or 6 nights at the
Carousel Club and whom Ruby had taken home after closing hours on each
of the nights she worked?</p>

<p>This was a girl that you tried to locate after Oswald was shot to help
you run the club?</p>

<p>Do you remember looking for such a girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Oh, that was the lady—oh—I don’t recall her name now—“Duckie”
or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us about that lady, in any case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, all I know is that Jack had told me she had some
knowledge of club running and that she was very smart and sharp and when
I had went to see him, he had suggested that if I—he <span class="locked">said——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean when you went to see him in jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, he said, “I don’t want to be involved with the club
any more, but if you want to do it, you can contact this lady.” He give me
her name—it was “Duckie” or something like that, to come down and give
you a hand, because she knows something about operating a club and you can
talk to Ralph about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you tried to find that girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I tried to contact her and I didn’t have any luck and I
told Ralph about it and he said “forget it.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, that girl you remember as being the girl who had been
around the club four or five or six times; isn’t that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that Jack used to take home at night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t mean to his house, but he did—he left with her, at any
rate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I don’t know whether he left with her or not because I leave
before he does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, do you remember making the statement to the FBI to the
effect you knew of one girl there that worked for 5 or 6 nights, it was the same
girl you looked for later, and that Ruby had taken her home after closing hours
on each of the nights she had worked there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say you went to see Jack in the jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many times did you go to see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Oh, five or six, maybe seven times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you alone with him all the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; there was always a policeman standing there. A guard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he talk about his difficulties?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he talk about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He talked mostly about the dogs <span class="locked">and——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he say about Sheba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Just that see that Sheba don’t eat too much because she will
get too fat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he say about leaving Sheba in the automobile that
Sunday when Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He didn’t say—he didn’t mention that to me. The first time
I went to see him I asked him where were Sheba and he told me he had left her
in the automobile and later on, so he told me, to contact the pound, to see if the
pound had Sheba, and would they release her, so I called the pound and the pound
said that they had her, and Joy Dale went out and picked her up and brought
her to the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s the McDonald girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s the McDonald girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell Jack about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack tell you how he got in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; he never discussed the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you about having sent a money telegram to Karen
Bennett that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He told me that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he tell you about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He said he had sent—that Little Lynn owed him $20 or $25,
whatever it was, he sent her, plus some more money that she had already drawed
that was not on the record, before they paid the payroll, and deduct it from her
salary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you the circumstances under which he had sent her
money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you he sent it by telegram?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He didn’t tell me he sent it by telegram—no; he didn’t tell
me, but Little Lynn told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did Little Lynn tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. She just said that Jack had sent her the money. You see,
I asked her first how much money had she drew and she told me and she also
told me that Jack had sent her about $25, I think it was, by telegram.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she tell you why she needed the money by wire?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; she didn’t tell me why.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Her pay wasn’t due until Sunday night, isn’t that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Until Sunday night, which we was closed, they didn’t get
paid Sunday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They got paid Monday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I think it was Tuesday before they got paid.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it was then that you deducted from Little Lynn’s pay the
amount that had been advanced to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you seen Jack yet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, I saw Jack on Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But he didn’t mention to you that the money had been sent to
her by telegram?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He—yes, he said that he sent the money—he said, “I sent
Little Lynn $25”—he said, “I sent Little Lynn $25.” He didn’t tell me about
telegram.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He never discussed with you at all how he got into the jail house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ever talk to you about, or did you know that he could
go to the police department and find his way about because he knew a lot of
people over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, he never talked to me about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know that to be a fact?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That he could do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On these 8 or 10 visits that you made to Jack, he never had
discussed with you one single aspect of the killing of Oswald, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the purpose of your visits, generally, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Oh, just, I guess to see how he was doing, to say, “Hello”
and to send him messages that the girls had sent him and carry his mail down
there if he had any addressed to him personally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How would you handle the mail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I would give it to Mr. Decker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The sheriff first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. To the sheriff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Has anybody given you any money other than what you have
earned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have had your regular salary all the time that you worked
for the Carousel until it closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it more or less than you were receiving before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, it was a little more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It was $60.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Instead of $45?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Other than that money, did you receive any money from Ralph
Paul or any of the brothers and sisters of Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or, from any other source?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, no more than tips, you know, like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, I understand that, but I mean no other sums of money in
excess of $5?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No other sums of money in excess of $5?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. $5?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, let’s put it this way—you received your salary and you
received tips?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you get any single tip that was over $5 at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Oh, yes; they had single tips—I always have. Certain customers
come in lots of times and give me $6 or $8 and sometimes $10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, would you say that $10 was the highest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Ten was about the highest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You haven’t received by way of tips any sum, say, more than
about $10?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, that was 1963 or 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No, I’m not talking about that far back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No—you mean after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand you to say you are having a hard time now, is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Very hard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have no money saved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. There was—it’s gone, you know, a few bucks that I had saved.
In fact, I have been paying bills.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much was that money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That I had saved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, it amount to about a couple of hundred dollars, I guess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had it in cash?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. In cash.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And other than that, you didn’t have any money anywhere?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I didn’t have any money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t have any money in any way—in a bank, I mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No more than—other than $90 I received from income tax.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean a refund?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. A refund. The reason why it was so hard is because my
wife, she lost her job, the business she worked for, they went out of business
just a little bit before the Carousel closed up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record. At this point Counsel Hubert marked exhibits
as hereinafter shown.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I have marked these exhibits as follows:</p>

<p>Exhibits 5300 A-F, inclusive; 5301 A-E, inclusive; 5302; 5303 A-M, 5304 A-B,
inclusive; 5304 A-S, inclusive; 5306 A-B, and 5307-A. Now, I show you a
group of pictures which I have marked for identification, “Dallas, Tex., April
14, 1964, as Exhibit 5300-A, -B, -C, -D, -E, and -F, Deposition of Andrew
Armstrong.” And I have signed my name on each one of them for identification,
there being six pictures altogether. I should like you now to look at
those six pictures after which I wish to ask you some questions regarding them.
Now, I ask you whether you recognize what place is in the background of these
pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(Examining pictures referred to.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, state what it is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. One of them <span class="locked">is——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; the place that’s in the background—that’s a picture of
what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Let me see—that’s the picture of the Carousel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are talking about Exhibit 5300-A?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that true also of Exhibit 5300-B?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, there are four others, Exhibits 5300-C, -D, -E, and -F. Is
the background of those pictures different from the background of Exhibits
5300-A and 5300-B?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is the background of Exhibits 5300, -C, -D, -E, and -F?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It’s the background of the Colony Club and the Empire
Cleaners.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that nearby the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, on all of these pictures in series Exhibits 5300, there is a
man, is there not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is that man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, in all of these pictures, there are two girls; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. One of them has blonde hair and seems to be dressed in black, has
a black sweater, apparently, and black pants visible in some of the picture; do
you know who she is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Kathy Kay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is her full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Kathy Coleman, I think it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, there is a second girl in there who seems to be dressed
in a dress with horizontal stripes in the top part of the dress and vertical
stripes in the bottom part of the dress, a blonde-haired girl, do you know
who she is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That is Alice Alexander.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Alice Alexander?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes—Alice Alexander.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, let’s turn first to Kathy Kay and let me ask you what
you know about her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Nothing; but she was a stripper and she was there when
I came here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the time when these pictures were taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; that’s the first time I ever saw them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you believe that Kathy Kay was a stripper when you first
went to the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And she was there all the way through the time you were
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. She was there all except for the time she left, for about maybe
3 weeks or maybe a month, and she came back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, she was there at the time Oswald was killed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; but not after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean she stopped after that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right—she stopped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the other girl whom you have identified as Alice
Alexander?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Alice Alexander—she was there when I got there and she
quit, and she and Jack would always—they would fight frequently and she
would come back, and she was there when—during the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As I understand it, she was there when you first went to work in
May 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did she do at the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. She was a waitress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She was not a stripper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And she and Jack would fight, you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. A difference of opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But they never got to hitting one another?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And she would quit sometime?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But she was there at the time of the assassination of the
President and of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, how long had she been there, dating back from the assassination
of the President and of Oswald, and from the last time she had
quit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Oh, it’s hard to <span class="locked">say——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. A month or so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. She had been back longer than that, I’m sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she quit once or more than once?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. She quit three or four times—I would say—about four times,
and was back in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s take the last time she quit, when did she quit the last
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. The last time was sometime during the summer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how long did she stay away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. About a month, I guess. She never was away no more
than a month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And do you remember about the time she came back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I sure don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think it would have been more than 2 months before the
President was killed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; I’m pretty sure it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think it would be more than 3 months?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I don’t know—I couldn’t say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are sure it would be more than 2 months but you are not
sure it would be as long as 3 months?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. As I say, if she had been working as a waitress all the time,
I would know, but a lot of times—half the time she was working as a cocktail
girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what is the difference between a cocktail girl and a stripper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well,—in other words, a cigarette girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, a cigarette girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. She would have the cigarettes—sell the cigarettes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she dress like she was dressed in the pictures that are
marked Exhibits 5300-A through 5300-E when she sold cigarettes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was the way she dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. She would be dressed in a dress. She was selling cigarettes
then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know if there was anything between Ruby and her of a
sexual nature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is she married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. She was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is she married to; do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. She has been married—but she was—I don’t know her husband’s
name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever know her by the name of Fillmore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know a girl by the name of Grace Fillmore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or Gloria Fillmore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t know any such person as Gloria Fillmore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened to this girl called Alice Alexander after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. She stopped for a while and then she came back later on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And she stayed until the club closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; she was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she have any boy friends you know of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not that I know of—she never had anybody come up there
<span class="locked">and——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And get her and take her home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. And get her and take her home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see Ruby taking her home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know where she lived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Somewhere in Irving, but I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. In Irving, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. [Spelling] I-r-v-i-n-g?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Wait a minute; I’m sorry, it’s not Irving—it’s Grand Prairie,
because there was an AN number—that’s Grand Prairie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that far from Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; it isn’t far from Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she drive a car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. She drives a car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I notice in the sign which appears in the background of
the photographs identified as Exhibits 5300-A and 5300-B, there are two other
names—Tammi True and Sal Ember—who is Tammi True?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Tammi True was a stripper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was she there at the time of the assassination?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she stay on afterwards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. She stayed on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Until the place closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. She wasn’t there at the time—she was there prior—no,
she was there before the assassination—some weeks she had quit—served out
her contract and she came back afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long <span class="locked">before——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. About a week, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t let me finish my question—how long before the assassination
of the President did her contract expire, so that she left or quit
about a week, you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. About a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And she had been there for some time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. She had been there—she was there when I got there and she
was booked there off and on all while I was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about Sal Ember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s not Sal Ember—that should have been—you see, some
of the letters are missing—this was—this should be Cindy Embers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s take the top line first—the pictures, Exhibits 5300-A and
5300-B show on the top line the letters [spelling] S-a-l. You say that that was
wrong and it should be something else and that some letters are missing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What should it have been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, the Sal should have been Sal Vincent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Vincent [spelling] V-i-n-c-e-n-t?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Something like that—I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was Sal Vincent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. A comedian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, the next name that appears on Exhibits 5300-A and 5300-B
in the sign in the background below the word [spelling] S-a-l, is the word Ember
[spelling] E-m-b-e-r, and I think you said that’s wrong too, because of the
absence of letters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What should have been the letters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Cindy Embers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Cindy [spelling] C-i-n-d-y?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Embers [spelling] E-m-b-e-r-s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And who was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. A stripper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was she there at the time of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did she leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. She left sometime ago—back, I think, the last time she was
booked there was back in the summer. She never worked there over 3 or 4
weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what about Sal Vincent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He did—the first month after Wally Weston left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did Sal Vincent leave, how long before the death of the
President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. About a month, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how long had he been there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. About a month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And now, is it safe to say then, that these two pictures, Exhibits
5300-A and 5300-B must have been taken during the month of October 1903?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Because that’s the only time when that sign would have made
sense as to when those people were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t recall the occasion when these pictures were taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Armstrong, it is necessary for us to recess your deposition
for a short period of time and during this recess will you please examine the other
pictures I have shown you and then we will resume your deposition later.</p>

<p>(Short recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Mr. Armstrong, we discontinued or recessed your deposition
about 20 minutes to a half hour ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And now we are recommencing it and you understand, of
course, that this is just merely a continuation of the deposition under the same
authority under which it began, and that you must consider yourself under
the same oath that you were at first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I show you a group of five pictures marked Exhibits
5301-A, B, C, D, and E. I have placed on the back of them “Dallas, Texas,
April 14, 1964, Deposition of Andrew Armstrong,” and signed my name and I
have given each one an exhibit number as indicated. Now, I would like for
you to look at those pictures for a while and then I am going to ask you some
questions concerning them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. [Examined exhibits referred to.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, in all of the five pictures which compose Exhibit 5301,
there is a man; who is that man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Also in all of those pictures there are two girls, and will you
agree with me that in all five of them one girl is always on the left side of the
picture as you look at it and one girl is always on the right side of the picture
as you look at it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell who the girl on the left side of the picture is in
each one of these pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Joy Dale.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Joy Dale?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. In other words she was Joyce McDonald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is the girl on the right-hand side, the blonde girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. “Little” Lynn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that the same as Karen Bennett Carlin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember when these pictures were taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I sure don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mentioned some time ago that you recall when some individual
named Rocco came in and took a group of pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you there when he took the pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not that particular one. I didn’t know he made that one.
It could have been done while I was out tending the bar or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recognize the scene that is in the pictures in the series
Exhibit 5301?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is that, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Jack’s office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is it the two girls are sitting on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s the couch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, tell us what you know about the girl in the left-hand side
of the picture as you look at it, that is to say, the girl with the dark hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, all I <span class="locked">know——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And whom I think you have identified as Joyce McDonald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whose stage name, shall we say, was what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Joy Dale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What do you know about her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Just that she is a stripper at the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long had she been there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. She had been there some—maybe 4 months before the
assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think she came about the middle of the summer, then,
July or August?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Let me see—let’s see—September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mid-September?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do—how do you fix that, Mr. Armstrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, it was around the time that Wally left. I don’t know
whether she was there right after Wally left or just before Wally left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had she ever been there before, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did she stay after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. She left sometime—during the—about 3 weeks in January
of 1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean she was there 3 weeks in January and then quit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know where she lived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What salary do those strippers get?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Anywhere from $100 to $125.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. A week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. A week—some of them made $150—some was $200.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what the relationship was between Joyce McDonald
and Jack Ruby, if any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Just a business relationship as far as I could see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she go out to dinner with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did there seem to be any kind of social relationship between
them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not that I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did there seem to be any kind of romantic or sexual relationship
between them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Ruby have any sexual or romantic relationships with any
of the girls in his club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I would say he had some, as far as I know romantic
relationships. In other words, he was always on the make.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, coming to Joyce McDonald, do you think she—that he was
on the make with respect to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I would not state definitely, but I believe he probably tried.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she have any boy friends around there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know whom she lived with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I sure don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she drive an automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. She didn’t drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did she get to and from work; do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Usually somebody would bring her to work—I only saw her
downstairs getting out of a car once and some man drove her to work, and that’s
the only time I ever saw her getting out of a car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You would usually leave at night before they did, didn’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the other girl, the one on the right-hand side of the
pictures as you look at them, which have been identified as series Exhibits
5301-A through 5301-E? I think you have said that the girls there, the blonde,
is “Little” Lynn or Karen Bennett Carlin, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She was married to Bruce Carlin?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; that’s what they said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She was the one, or rather her husband was the one that Jack
didn’t want around the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She was the one, I think, that you called on Friday, the day of
the assassination to tell her that the club would be closed that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that you could not reach the next day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, do you know anything about either of these two girls that
you have not testified to so far?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I show you a single picture which I have marked on here
for the purpose of identification as follows: “Dallas, Texas, April 14, 1964,
Exhibit 5302, Deposition of Andrew Armstrong,” and I have signed my name,
and I ask you to look at that picture. It seems to be the picture of a man, and I
ask you whether you can identify that man or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s Rocco, the photographer, that made the pictures—took
the series of pictures at the Carousel Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was there for a week, you said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what period of time was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What period of time was he there—when was that week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Around the 1st of November.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From the 1st to the 7th or 8th of November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Something like that—yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he pay anything for the purpose of taking those pictures—did—to
your knowledge, did he pay anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He got the consent of Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I want to show you a series of pictures which have been
marked for identification as follows, to wit:</p>

<p>“Dallas, Texas, April 14, 1904, Exhibit 5303, Deposition of Andrew Armstrong,”
and I have marked my name on each of them, and they are numbered, in addition
to Exhibit No. 5303, of which they form a part of the series, they are numbered
A through I, and I ask you to look at those pictures, please.</p>

<p>Mr. Armstrong [examined pictures referred to].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, now you have examined the several pictures constituting
Exhibit 5303, marked in a series as A through I, and I will ask you whether
you can recognize anybody in any of these pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s then take Exhibit No. 5303-A, first, and tell me whom you
recognize in that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. This right here—the first picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We are talking about the top picture on the left hand side—right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right—is Joy Dale, and the M.C. that’s shown in all of these
pictures, the little man on the stage—give me a minute and I will try to think
of his name, but coming down the line, the second picture on the left hand side
is Tammi True.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s the girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s the girl—she is being held up by a very huge gentleman
by the name of—oh—I know his name—his name is Tiny—he comes in
the club quite often and he usually gets the same seat—a special chair we
had there for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This picture appears several times, does it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, it appears in the third row of the left-hand
picture?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it appears in the bottom row of the left-hand picture,
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How often would that man come to the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he started to coming there back in the summer—last
summer and he was usually there—he very seldom missed a weekend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You knew him only as Tiny?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. As Tiny.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never heard his last name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he friendly with Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not friendly—just that—he didn’t well, you could say they
was friendly, but they didn’t know each other, anything about each other’s
backgrounds, or anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him talking with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, not conversationally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see them go out together and come back together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he spend a lot of money there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, a few beers was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see him with anyone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He always came alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. One time he came there with a couple other guys, but just
once, otherwise, he was all alone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know the other men he came with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t remember when he came in with the other two men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No—the top picture <span class="locked">is——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Wait a minute, before we leave the big man called Tiny, when
was the last time you saw him, to your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Three or four nights ago—Saturday night—I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean this past Saturday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are talking about April 11?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. At the Theatre Lounge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you work there now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, I stopped by and say hello to a friend of mine that works
there and bartends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he was over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I have saw him in there, oh, about four times I think in the
last month—I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And prior to that, when was the last time you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Prior to that—the last time I saw him was at the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Oh, I would say it was probably the last weekend before
we closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He continued to come to the club, then, after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever talk to him about Ruby’s shooting Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever hear him talk to anybody else about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, never did. The reason why he’s got to be so popular
is because he is a helper—he cracks a few jokes and the M.C.’s like to talk to
him because he don’t get out of line when they talk to him, and he is usually
called on during the spinning of the roulette wheel, or something like that,
and if he won a bottle of champagne or something like that, it was a big thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he employed by the club?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, he wasn’t employed, he was just a regular customer that
has very nice conduct and has a good sense of humor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, the M.C.’s figure they can always get a kick
out of him, which would amuse the audience?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I show you a picture which is marked for identification
as Exhibit 5303-1, and ask you if that is not that same fat man on the right-hand
middle of the picture, with a white shirt, with his right hand on his hip
and the left hand leaning on the stage right by the microphone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s the man, Tiny, that you have identified as being in Exhibit
5303-A; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And while we are looking at Exhibit 5303-I, who is the girl
dancing there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Kathy Kay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recognize anybody else in the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. The waitress over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean the one with the white blouse?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And she has dark hair; you can’t see her face, but you can see
the back of her figure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I think it’s Bonnie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Bonnie who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Bonnie Kelley is all I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That girl you are identifying is in the left middle of the picture;
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Right behind the man with the gray suit and with his left hand
by his mouth and a cigarette in his left hand; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s correct; and this is Tiny’s usual position—his usual
sitting position—he always gets this table right here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I wish you would just take these pictures, starting with
Exhibit 5303-B, and just state for the record who is in the picture that you
know, identifying each of the particular frames, by saying whether it is in
the top row, second row, third row, or fourth row, and then whether it is on
the left-hand side, the middle, or the right-hand side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. On the top row on the left-hand side is Tammi True. On
the top row in the middle is Tammi True.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, perhaps we could shorten this by putting it this
way: On this number of pictures, 12 to be exact, of Exhibit 5303-B, the
girl who is doing the act is Tammi True—right—in all of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It isn’t?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. On the series of pictures in the left line down from the
top to bottom and in the middle from top to bottom is Tammi True. The
pictures on the right-hand side—the brighter pictures—are Joy Dale.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All four of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. All four of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On the right-hand side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have identified the pictures on Exhibit 5303-B?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, will you look at Exhibit 5303-C? There are 12 pictures
on that, and they are all the same girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. They are all the same girl, Kathy Kay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recognize anyone else in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No one else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, take Exhibit 5303-D. There are 12 pictures in that
and they are all of the same girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; they are all the same girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is she?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Little Lynn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I’ll ask you to look at Exhibit 5303-E. There are 12
pictures on that, showing various poses of a girl, is it all the same girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; all the same girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Joy Dale.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there anybody else in there you recognize?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No one else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, take the next picture, which has been identified as Exhibit
5303-F, also consisting of 12 pictures, except that in the second row the
middle picture is blank, so that there are really only 11 pictures, and I ask
you if the same girl is in all those pictures; that is to say, the dancer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, then, let’s take the left-hand row from top to bottom. Is
it the same girl in those four pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Same girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Kathy Kay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And in the middle series there is a top picture and the next
one down is blank and then the third and fourth rows from the top, there are
two others—who is in those pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Kathy Kay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In all of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. All of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, move to the right-hand row; there are four pictures from
the top down, and will you identify them? Are they different girls in those
pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; that’s Little Lynn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They are all of Little Lynn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there anybody else in there you recognize in those pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Just a waitress in the bottom picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In the bottom right-hand picture; right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The girl with dark glasses on, on the right-hand side of that
picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does she have shorts on, or something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. She has some white slacks on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And a black sweater?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Bonnie Kelley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think that’s the girl you identified in a previous picture; is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Anybody else you recognize?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; no one else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I show you a group of 12 pictures identified as Exhibit
5303-G, and ask you if the same girl is in all of those pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. The same girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is the girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Tammi True.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Anybody else you recognize in any of those pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, I show you an exhibit marked 5303-H, also a group of 12
pictures, and ask you to start with the row of 4 pictures on the right-hand side
from the top to the bottom; who is in those 4 pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Kathy Kay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Kathy Kay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, no; on the right-hand side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On the right-hand side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; this is Joy Dale.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She is in all four of those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. All four of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, take the middle row; who is the girl in those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Kathy Kay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recognize the man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; the left-hand row of four pictures—the two from the top—the
first and second pictures from the top, can you identify those people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Kathy Kay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, the lower pictures on the left-hand row; there are two
people, a man and a girl; who are they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s Kathy Kay; I don’t know who the man is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he employed by the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Mr. Armstrong, we have been taking your deposition all
day and it is now 5:15 p.m., and I suggest that we adjourn and that you come
back Thursday morning—can you do that—or Thursday afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you come in without any further notice on Thursday,
April 16?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; we will recess your deposition until that time and complete
it on Thursday, April 16.</p>

<h2 id="ARMSTRONG_RESUMED">TESTIMONY OF ANDREW ARMSTRONG, JR. RESUMED</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of Andrew Armstrong, Jr., was taken at 9:12 a.m., on April 16,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the
President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Armstrong, you recall that day before yesterday we recessed
the taking of your deposition because it was getting late in the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And we made an appointment to continue it today at 1:30,
but that was changed again to 9 o’clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s satisfactory with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you understand that what we are going to do today is
simply a continuation of the deposition that was begun the other day; you understand
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That I am acting under the same authority, that you are here
in the same way that you were here before, and that you are under the same
oath that you were under when you testified before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Except there has been a recess just like there was on Tuesday
when we recessed for lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Only this recess has been a little longer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Armstrong, when we left off the other day, you had been
examining a number of pictures which had been marked for identification as
Exhibit 5303, and I believe that you had examined all of the pictures in that
series except those marked for identification as Exhibits 5303-J, K, L, and M.
Now, I show you, first of all, the picture identified as Exhibit 5303-J, and ask
you if you recognize what place is pictured there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s the Carousel Club.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recognize anybody in that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I recognize the girl standing on the stage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean the girl with the dark skirt, light sweater, and with
long tresses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The picture shows only the back of her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, she is right back of the microphone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is that girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Tammi True.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is the man just in front of her, right in the center of the
picture, leaning over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s a customer; I don’t know who he is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know who he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you ever seen him before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recognize anybody else in that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Just the M.C. standing back by the girl, but I can’t recall his
name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say “the M.C.,” you are, referring to the person in that
picture whose head stands between Tammi True and the customer you have
identified and actually right above the top of the microphone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was an M.C.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I can’t recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that Wally Weston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who followed Wally Weston; do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Sal Vincent; he followed Wally Weston, and this guy followed
Sal Vincent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It that Bill DeMar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember when Sal Vincent left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Sal was only there 2 or 3 weeks. In other words, you could
say the last part of—during the last part of September, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was Vincent, you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; Sal Vincent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then he left, you mean, in the last part of September?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was there about 3 weeks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. About 3 weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And Wally Weston had been there before him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long had Weston been there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Wally had been there since about June 1062.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, he had been there about 15 months when he left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he was following Sal Vincent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And Sal Vincent stayed 3 weeks, until about the end of September?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And this man you have identified as the M.C. in Exhibit 5303-J
took his place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he stayed how long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He stayed about a month, I would say; he stayed about a
month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you say that he stayed until about November 1 or later?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; I would say he stayed about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And who followed him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Bill DeMar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how long did Bill stay—Bill DeMar stay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Bill DeMar stayed up until after the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how long had Bill DeMar been there when the assassination
took place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. 3 weeks—3 or 4 weeks, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You think that Bill DeMar came in there about the 1st of
November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that he took the place of Sal Vincent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes—no—no, he took the place of this man right here [indicating
picture].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. The man I can’t identify.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He took the place of the man whose name you can’t remember,
in Exhibit 5303-J, but whose name you don’t remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If you do happen to remember his name a little later on, will
you interrupt me and tell us about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recognize anybody else in that picture, identified as Exhibit
5303-J?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, then I show you a picture which has been marked for
identification as Exhibit 5303-K, and I ask you to look at it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. All right [examining instrument referred to].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what the place is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, that’s the club—I’m sure of that—I’m sure that that is
the Carousel Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recognize anybody in it at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; the waitress in the upper right-hand corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The waitress in the far background in the upper right-hand
corner, whose profile can be seen, and also her left arm—she seems to have a
white blouse on, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She is standing by a picture frame or a window or something,
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s our little Margie—her name is Margie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Margie what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Margie Norman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recognize anybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I’m marking with an arrow, which I am placing my initials on,
and I ask you to place your initials on next to that arrow too, and the arrow
points to a man about in the center of the picture at the bottom, and he has on
what appears to be a grayish checked shirt—you can see him by profile—he
parts his hair on his left side. Do you know who that man is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever seen him before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you recognize nobody else in the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I show you pictures marked for identification as Exhibits
5303-L, and ask you if you recognize the place, first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It’s the Carousel Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is on the stage holding the mike?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who else is in the picture that you recognize?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No one else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I show you another picture which has been identified as Exhibit
5303-M, and ask you first if you can identify the place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is the man on the stage holding the mike?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recognize anybody else in the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I show you a picture which has been marked for identification
as Exhibit 5304-A and ask you to look at that picture and tell us, first of
all, if you recognize the place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it the Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know it is not the Carousel; how do you distinguish
it from the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, the whole picture—it’s definitely not the Carousel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did the Carousel have that kind of furniture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did it have a bar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did it have a bar with liquor bottles on it like that one does?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did it have chandeliers like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recognize any person in that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, I sure don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know the man sitting at the table in the foreground of
the picture who is being served a drink by a girl in costume?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever seen him at the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I don’t remember him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever seen him anywhere?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the girl who is serving him the drink, do you recognize
her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have never seen her any place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, do you see a man in the picture near the bar who appears
to be the bartender?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean you don’t see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I see him, but I can’t see him too clear—I don’t recognize
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know a man by the name of Mike Ryan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that Mike Ryan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are certain that it is not Mike Ryan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was Mike Ryan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He was just a—he came in—the first time I ever met him he
was with Jack, and he was sort of a lone wolf sort of on the go all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he come around the Carousel very much?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. At one time—I would say it was within a period of a couple
of weeks he was around there quite often.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was that period of a couple of weeks that he came around
there very often?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I don’t recall—it was during last summer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean the summer of 1963?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would it have been when Wally Weston was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It was when Wally Weston was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he come after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But not as often?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever hear of Ruby and him discussing anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, I guess, business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. They were discussing business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They were discussing business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Jack was always discussing some kind of business with somebody—he
always had some kind of idea about another club or another kind of
business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what kind of business he was discussing with the
man you have named as Mike Ryan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. A private club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You heard such a conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean another private club in addition to the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, the Carousel wasn’t a private club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, I see; so in other words, the thought was to open a private
club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Just talk though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And talk is all you would know about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes. I mean—it was just one of Jack’s wild ideas, that’s all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why do you characterize it as a wild idea?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he always had these ideas—it was something this day
and something the next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But the only reason you are saying this was a wild idea is because
you are thinking it was like some of his other wild ideas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But other than that you don’t know whether it was a wild idea
or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know of any other business between Ryan and Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; no more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they go out socially?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you seen Ryan since the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he came up to the club a couple of times and I saw him
the day he left for California, at least that’s where he told me he was going.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It must have been around the first of December.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean it was right after Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You haven’t seen him since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you what business he had in California?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, he didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many times after Oswald was shot do you suppose you saw
Ryan in the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. A couple of times, oh, two or three times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he talk to you about Ruby and what had happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; no more than anybody else did. He said, everybody
would always ask me, “What’s wrong with your boss?” And he said the same
thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know a man by the name of Tommy, who used to go
out with Joy Dale, kind of a boy friend of hers?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. A baseball player?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, there was a guy that used to bring her to work sometime,
so she said, but I never saw him, and he came up and worked—handled
the door sometimes for Jack, he did, and they would always sit down and talk
together—he and Joy Dale.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, after Oswald was shot and you remained on, and Mr. Paul
began to operate the club, did Mr. Paul get anybody to handle the front door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Leo Torti handled the front door most of the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old a man was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I take he was in his late forties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have a little gray in his hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. A little gray.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He handled the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He handled the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see him and this man Torti we are talking about
sitting together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; Tommy always sat close to the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He handled the door sometimes himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Sometimes; himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. I show you a picture that has been identified as
Exhibit 5304-B and ask you if you can recognize the place that is pictured in
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; it is not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know any of the people who are pictured in that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I sure don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I will show you a group of photographs which have been
identified as follows: “Dallas, Texas, April 14, 1964, Deposition of Andrew
Armstrong, Exhibit 5305-A through 5305-S.”</p>

<p>All of these also bear an Exhibit No. 5225, April 10, 1964, deposition of C. L.
Crafard, and I will ask you to look at them, starting with Exhibit A and see
if you recognize what those pictures show?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span> [examining pictures referred to]. This picture here <span class="locked">shows——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s the first one, and that is Exhibit 5305-A, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It shows the back of a 10-cent notebook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The back of whose notebook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I can’t identify that because I don’t know—it could be
anybody’s notebook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It appears to you to be a 10-cent notebook, because it says “10
cents” on the front of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see a book which had a back and front like that
which appears in the picture, Exhibit 5305-A?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Lots of places.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see any at the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see any in Jack Ruby’s possession?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack Ruby have one that had a back and front like the one
in the picture, Exhibit 5305-A?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He did not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean he did not, or you don’t know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he could have—I never saw it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never saw it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, would you look at the rest of those pictures, just taking
them as they are and putting them face down, and see if you recognize any of the
writings or names or anything else in those pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. This is Jack’s handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You recognize Jack’s handwriting—in which ones?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. In all of them that I have seen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s in all of them that you have seen so far?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, at the time you made the remark that you recognized Jack’s
handwriting, I think you were on the picture that is identified as Exhibit 5305-B.
You had also looked at Exhibit 5305-C?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now I ask you to look at the whole bunch and tell us if they
are in Jack’s handwriting or not?</p>

<p>(Mr. Armstrong examines instruments referred to.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you’ve gone through the whole series of photographs and,
which are photographs of pages of books that have been identified as Exhibit
5305-A through Exhibit 5305-S, and I ask you if you can tell us whose handwriting
is in those books?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It appears to me that it is Jack’s handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There’s a lot of it that is in print, isn’t there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recognize that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Especially the print.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. His print—you recognize his prints?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. We both printed more than we wrote.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have seen his print before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It’s your opinion that that is his print?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see the book before—the original of which these
exhibits are pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; he always had a little notebook, but it was one that
opened—not to pull the page up, but opened just like a regular book, you know,
a little small book about 2 inches by 1½ inches—just a very little small book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, as you went through these pictures, Exhibits 5305-A through
5305-S, did you recognize any names or numbers or addresses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I saw Little Lynn’s name there and I saw Tom
Palmer’s name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tom who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Tom Palmer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is Tom Palmer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He’s one of the union agents—he was the Dallas union agent
for the AGVA.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recognize any other names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I wasn’t looking at the names—just mostly handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Perhaps you had better go through and look at them with the
names in mind and take them one by one and tell us any names you can recognize
in anyway.</p>

<p>The first one is Exhibit 5305-A, and that’s the cover. No. 5305-B is the one—now,
if you recognize anything, stop so that we can identify the exhibit number
of the picture that you recognize.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I recognize the name “Vegas Club” on the top of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are talking about Exhibit 5305-D. Is there any significance
to you other than that you recognize the name “Vegas Club” on that exhibit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Just that they have some figures there for tax, which is the
usual procedure of putting them down—the usual way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just go on and if you have no recognition of any picture, just
pass it without comment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I recognize the print on this as excise tax for the Carousel
Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What exhibit are you talking about—is that Exhibit 5305-H?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any significance to that recognition other than you recognize
this, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I recognize what it means—I recognize the name Tom Palmer
and his home phone number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your comment is directed to Exhibit 5305-H, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; I recognize the name Bro. Bear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are referring to Exhibit 5305-M, and you recognize a name
on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Bro. Bear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. [Spelling.] “B-r-o. B-e-a-r” and underneath that is “Service”
and then there is a telephone number—LA 8-1767.”</p>

<p>What do you recognize about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Just the name Bro. Bear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He was an entertainer at the Vegas Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What kind of entertainment did he do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I think he sings and he played some instrument—I don’t
know which.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he ever at the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see a name on that same Exhibit 5305-M, “Bertha Cheek,” do
you recognize that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know of any person by that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I also see on this same Exhibit No. 5305-M at the bottom of the
page, Bob Litchfield [spelling] L-i-t-c-h-f-i-e-l-d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I have heard the name but I don’t know who it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whose handwriting is that entry in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Whose handwriting is that in—I’m not going to say that
that’s Jack’s, because his handwriting—I can’t tell too much about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You can’t be sure that that’s Jack’s handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; not the writing, but the printing I could—if it was
printing I could—the numbers look like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know who Bob Litchfield was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Bob Litchfield; Bob Littlefield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Littlefield; it is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, I’m sorry—I was reading it wrong—perhaps that is right,
this says [spelling] L-i-c-h-f-i-e-l-d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s a magazine—let’s see—I don’t know. It was the
“Around Town” magazine, I think it was the Littlefield “Around Town” magazine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was a man called Bob Littlefield?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you read the name here at the bottom of the page as
“Littlefield”. Let’s put it this way—you have already told us about a man
named Bob Littlefield—what do you know about a man named Bob Lichfield
here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nothing at all; you never heard of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would it make any difference to you that he might have been
known as Bill Lichfield?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t know a Bill Lichfield?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; go on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I recognize the man—I recognize the name “Little Lynn.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are talking about Exhibit 5305-S?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. And it has her phone number.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say you recognize “Little Lynn,” you have already testified
about her, I believe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I show you two pictures that have been marked for identification
as Exhibits 5306-A and 5306-B, each of which purports to be pictures
of three memo slips, and ask you if you recognize them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I can’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know whose handwriting they are in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It doesn’t look like Jack’s handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recognize any names or telephone numbers on those
memo slips?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have looked at all six of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you read the messages that each contained?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Oh, yes; here’s one—I <span class="locked">think——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you are talking about the memo slip on the right-hand
side of the pictures as you look at it, the picture having been identified as
Exhibit 5306-B. Now, will you comment on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I had asked you whether the message meant anything to you.
You seemed to indicate that the message on the picture I have described does
indicate something to you, and now I ask you what does it indicate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I’m sorry. I made a mistake—it doesn’t, but this one
here, the one in the center, I think that’s Palmer—Tom Palmer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you are referring to the middle slip on the picture identified
as Exhibit 5306-A, and you say the message there you recognize; right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What makes you recognize it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. The telephone number and the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, the memo slip that you are talking about, and I repeat
for identification, that it is the middle memo slip on Exhibit No. 5306-A,
apparently is addressed to Ruby because it has his name there, although one
can see in the picture, can’t one, that there was a word that looks like somebody
started to write “Armstrong” and then stopped—right—or something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the date is 11-14 at 3:40, and then there was printed “while
you were out Pauline [spelling] P-a-u-l-i-n-e phoned, FE 7-5992.” It looks like.</p>

<p>And then there is a checkmark in the block “telephoned” and a checkmark
in the block “please call” and the message is: “This one I couldn’t tell if she
was colored or white,” is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you identified that with Palmer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It looked like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, if you were mistaken, say so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; I was mistaken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have any recollection of that message now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there any that you had any recognition about, any one
of the six memo slips on the Exhibits 5306-A and 5306-B?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I will show you an exhibit that has been identified as
Exhibit 5307-A. It is a picture of one slip of paper, and I ask you if you
could identify that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; now I show you photostats of a number of pages
in a book, which have been identified the other day when you first were here:
“Dallas, Texas, April 14, 1964, Exhibits 5308, Deposition of Andrew Armstrong,”
and I ask you to look at all those pictures first, and tell me if you recognize
that book at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I’ve already looked at them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recognize it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about it do you recognize? What book was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. This is a little notebook that Larry carried around and took
messages on and wrote checks, phone numbers, and things down on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see it before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. At the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was it at the club—where was it kept?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Larry kept it in his pocket, although, when he left, he left
it there with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He left it where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He left it at the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He left it with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No, no; he just left it at the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, when you came back to the club, the day after
Larry left, to clean up, I think you found some other things of his and you
found that too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or, did you find that at another time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not that same day. No; I didn’t find it then—it was later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you find it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Sometime after the club opened back up—I don’t know
whether it was Monday or Tuesday—whatever day the FBI’s came up this
day, I found this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It was in the room where he slept.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you find it on the same day that you found the letters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They were together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you turned them over to the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I think you said you have looked over that book already—the
other day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there anything significant about that book you wish to comment
upon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; I can recognize a few names in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall if they were names of any people that you have
not so far mentioned in your deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; I <span class="locked">think——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; I would like you to go through and pick out the names
of the people that have not yet been discussed by you as part of your deposition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Here is a name—Mike Shore—I’ve heard it before—I think
he is an agent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s on the first page, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; and here is a name—Abe Kleinman—which is the
accountant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s on the second page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. The name Earl Ruby, that’s Jack’s brother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s on the second page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. The name Doris and Peggy, on the second page, which they
had called for to apply for jobs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you speak to them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No; Larry did himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know, then, that they had called to apply for jobs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he told me—he wrote the name down and it was the
day we were looking for waitresses, and he give me the numbers, and I didn’t
reach them as they were not at home or something, and the name Bill DeMar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was he?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He’s an M.C.—the name Mike Ryan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you have already talked to us about Mike Ryan, haven’t
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. The name Little Lynn—I have already talked to you about
that. Here’s a name—Bobby Patterson of—I’ve heard of, I don’t know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What have you heard about him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Nothing—I just heard the name—I forget what he was
connected with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let the record show that the witness is looking over the pictures,
and that as he has any comment, he has been asked to make such comment
without further questioning from me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes; I recognize the back of the notebook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the back of the notebook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I just recognize that that’s the notebook that belonged to
Larry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I show you a document which is described as a photostatic
copy of some sort of a notebook which has been identified as follows: This page
is marked, “Dallas. Texas, April 14, 1964,” which is when your deposition began,
“Exhibit 5309-A, Deposition of Andrew Armstrong,” and I have signed it.</p>

<p>Let the record show also that this exhibit is also marked “Washington, D.C.,
Deposition of C. L. Crafard, Exhibit 5302, April 9, 1964,” and under which
appears the name of Mr. Burt Griffin.</p>

<p>This exhibit consists of nine pages. There is typewritten on the front of it,
“Notebook number 1,” found on the left-hand bottom of the exhibit, and the
number “(1)” and then on each of the subsequent pages there is typewritten
there at the right-hand side, “No. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9,” in that sequence.</p>

<p>I ask you if you can identify that document? Now, look the whole thing over
and we will do it in this way. I want you to look it all over first and tell me
without making any comment, and then tell me whether you identify it or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span> [examining instrument referred to].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, now you have looked over all of these pages, and first
I ask you whether you recognize the book at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recognize the handwriting or printing in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I believe once—one time a long time ago Jack had a notebook
like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you say now whether the one you think he had a long time
ago is shown in these photostatic pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. It must be, because my old telephone number is in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your recognition of the book, though, is not based on an actual
recognition now, but an assumption, isn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You really can’t recognize that as Jack’s handwriting or have
a distinct independent recollection of having seen the original of which those
pages are photos?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I’ll ask you to do as you have done with the last exhibit,
and that is to look over each page and see if you recognize any name or number?
If you do not, pass to the next page. If you do, stop and tell us what page it is
on and then make what comments you have to make.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span> [examining instrument referred to]. First, I’ll say I believe
that is Jack’s handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, a moment ago you said you couldn’t be sure—have
you changed your mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What caused you to do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Certain letters here that I know his way of printing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, go on with the examination of each page as I have asked
you to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. The name Bill Willis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What page are you talking about—that is typewritten at the
bottom of page 4—right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. At the bottom of page 4.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Bill Willis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recognize that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He was a drummer at the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was he a drummer at the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Ever since I been there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he there until the place closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, he was there almost 2 years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He was there longer than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he and Jack get along all right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. They got along better than anybody else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What evidence did you see to support that conclusion on your
part?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, Bill Willis was one of the few guys that I ever heard
Jack say was a nice guy—continuously.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was—so, your assumption that they got along better than anyone
else is based on what Jack told you about him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was that Jack continuously said he was a nice guy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. He liked him and everybody else did, because he is really a
wonderful person. I recognize my phone number and the name “Andy.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s on page 4?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. On page 4—I recognize the name “Wally Weston.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s on page 6?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. That’s on page 6. I have heard Jack mention the name Joe
Cook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s on page 6, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know Joe Cook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did Jack have to say about him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, he just mentioned him in his business—I’ve forgotten
what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did he mention Joe Cook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I can’t recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would it have been shortly after you got there, towards the end,
or about the middle of the time you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I don’t know—I couldn’t say. I recognize the name Peggy
Steele.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was on page 8—who was Peggy Steele?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. She was a stripper that was booked there for about a month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long ago—what period of time was she there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I don’t know—it was sometime about the fall of 1962, I would
say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She was there for about a month?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After she left, did you ever see her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was she ever around the club any more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was the fall of 1962, not 1963; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. 1962—yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you have gone through all of the pages 1 through 9 of Exhibit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
5309-A, and I understand that you have made all the comments that you
have to make about any of the entries on those various pages, and that is to
say that you made a comment as to any name that had any significance to you
at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And if you have not commented on the name, that means that
the name has no significance to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am going to ask you to do substantially the same thing with
another document that I am handing you that has been identified, “Dallas,
Texas, April 14, 1964,” and this was marked for identification on your last
appearance. It is marked as Exhibit 5309-B, “Deposition of Andrew Armstrong.”
I have signed it. The document consists of 20 pages. It is a photostat
of an original, apparently. It has written in type “Notebook No. (2), page
1,” on the first page, and then on each of the subsequent pages there are
numbers running from 2 to 20.</p>

<p>I would also like to have the record note that this exhibit has also been
marked as “Exhibit 5204,” relative to the deposition of C. L. Crafard.</p>

<p>I would like you first of all to look through all of the pages for the purpose
of a general identification, after which I am going to ask you to go over each
page as you did the previous document.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. [Examining instrument referred to.] Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let the record show that the witness is examining each page of
the exhibit.</p>

<p>Now, you have looked at all of the pages of that Exhibit 5309-B, and you
have identified it all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes—no—well, yes, I have looked at it but I haven’t identified
it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, we’ll put it this way—have you ever seen the original
of which this exhibit is a series of pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have never seen that address book, or whatever it is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I don’t remember seeing this—now, I could have, but I don’t
remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t remember ever having seen it at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Let me make this statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, go ahead—you wish to make a statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Jack kept a number of little books and little pieces of paper
wrapped up with a rubber band in his coat pocket and whenever he got ready
to look for anything he would take it out and run through it, take out one
of those little books, which I didn’t pay any attention to it—this could be one
of the little books he had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you do not recognize it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you don’t believe you have ever seen it before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I will ask you to go over each individual page and if there
is any entry or name that has any significance to you or that you recognize in
any way, stop and identify the page and then make your comment. If, as you
turn the pages over and examine them you have no recognition or the entries
are not significant to you, then your silence as to each page will mean precisely
that.</p>

<p>That is to say, that those entries mean nothing to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. [Examining instrument referred to.] I recognize the name
Sam Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s what page—the page you are referring seems to be unnumbered—an
unnumbered page, but it is the third page back from the one that
is numbered 20, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is Sam Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Jack Ruby’s brother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he around the club much?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever meet him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you meet him before Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you meet him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I met him at the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Three or four times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever speak to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Oh, nothing—he would tell me about his business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was the last time you saw him prior to the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. The last time I saw him was at the trial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was the last time you saw him prior to the assassination
of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I can’t recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, did you see any other names that you recognized in
that exhibit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Mr. Armstrong, the other day I asked you to read a number
of reports which purport to be reports by agents of the FBI of interviews
of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you read them at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Those were marked for identification the other day as follows:</p>

<p>“The interview by Special Agent Lish and Wilson, dated November 26, as
Exhibit 5310-A,” consisting of two pages; the interview on November 27, consisting
of one page, which was identified as Exhibit 5310-B; the interview of
December 9, 1963, consisting of one page was identified as Exhibit 5310-C; and
another interview of December 9, 1963, consisting of one page and which is
identified as Exhibit 5310-D; the interview of December 13, 1963, consisting of
one page and was identified as Exhibit 5310-E; the exhibit of December 19, 1963,
was identified as Exhibit 5310-F; and exhibit dated January 22, 1964, was
identified as Exhibit 5310-G, and it consists of four pages.</p>

<p>I have signed my name on the margin of the first page and my initials at
the right-hand bottom of all the other pages.</p>

<p>I think you have read these various exhibits carefully the other day, did you
not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As a matter of fact, if my recollection serves me right, it took
you about an hour or so, did it not, to do so; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you wish to look them over again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I’m going to ask you a question, and if you do wish to
look them over again, in the light of my question, please say so, because you
will be allowed to do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I want to know is whether or not these various Exhibits
5310-A through 5310-G are fair reports and correct reports of the interviews
with the various agents of the FBI on the dates dated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you notice anything that was incorrect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes—not in this, but in the statement that I made day
before yesterday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you mean that when you say something was incorrect—you
mean you said something was incorrect the other day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, we’ll get to that in a moment, but before we do, let’s
dispose of these Exhibits 5310-A through 5310-G.</p>

<p>As far as you know, and you have read them, there is nothing in those
exhibits that is incorrect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It represents the truth as you know it and as you told it to
the FBI agents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you say that there was something that was incorrect the
other day that you said while in the course of your deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you tell us what that was, please, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. When you asked me what time did I leave the club on
Saturday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. I said 8 o’clock and in the report here it says 9, and after
I read the report, I remembered that it was 9 o’clock when I left the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, the correction you want to make, then, is not
in the FBI report but in your own testimony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your memory has now been refreshed by the report and you
actually recollect that your time of departure from the club on Saturday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was 9 o’clock rather than 8 o’clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Everything was right but the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Everything you said there was right except the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Except the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you wish to correct your previous testimony insofar as
you stated that you left at 8 o’clock, so that the record will show that in
fact you left at 9 o’clock on Saturday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. November 23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you are telling me the reason you wish to make that correction
is because of what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Because I remember that after reading the statement that
it was 9 o’clock when I left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, do you have an independent recollection of having left
at 9 o’clock instead of 8 o’clock, or are you simply relying upon what the
FBI record shows you must have told them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, no; it just brought back to my memory that it was
originally set at 8 o’clock that I was going to leave. Then, before Jack left,
he said, “Why don’t you make it 9” and I didn’t want to, but I said, “Okay,”
and that’s when we got in the argument over the telephone and he wanted
me to stay on until 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And at that time I thought you said you went ahead and left
anyhow at 8 o’clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, 1 did, but I went ahead and left anyway at 9 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you were in error the other day when you said that after
the argument with Jack you went ahead and left at 8, the time you had agreed
upon anyhow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He wanted you to stay until 10?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had agreed to stay until 8?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you actually stayed until 9; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Mr. Armstrong, have you ever been interviewed before you
met me by any member of the President’s Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, of course, you have testified before me for a whole day now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
almost a half clay, and necessarily there have been some conversations between
us that have not been on the record, not purposely so, but simply at recess time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, even including everything that has occurred, all conversations
between us at recess time or going down the elevator or one thing or another,
is there anything that we discussed at those recess times which you can
remember has not been brought up and recorded in this deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, we haven’t discussed anything concerning the business
that we was discussing on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you mean we might have discussed things unrelated to this
inquiry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Well, I’ll just put it this way—I don’t think we have discussed
anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t have any recollection of anything at all that we have
discussed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And in any case, if we might have discussed anything, it has
been brought out on this record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it fair to state that anyone who would read your deposition
of the other day and today and would read the FBI reports as to what you told
them, which you have said are correct, would have a true and correct version of
all that you know about the matter we have been talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there anything that you can think of that is not contained in
either your deposition or the statements that you have made to the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you anything else to say, Mr. Armstrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Not a thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, we certainly do thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>. Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="CHEEK">TESTIMONY OF MRS. BERTHA CHEEK</h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The testimony of Mrs. Bertha Cheek was taken at 10:15 a.m., on April 14, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Burt W. Griffin, assistant counsel of the President’s
Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me introduce myself. I am Burt Griffin. I am a member of
the advisory staff of the General Counsel’s office of the President’s Commission
investigating the assassination of President Kennedy. I want to tell you a little
bit about the Commission and what our purpose is and so forth, Mrs. Cheek,
before we actually get into the taking of the testimony.</p>

<p>The Commission was set up pursuant to an Executive order of President Johnson
which was issued on November 30, 1963, and also pursuant to a joint resolution
of Congress. Under these two official acts, the Commission has been given
authority to take testimony and to promulgate rules and regulations and so forth.
Under these rules and regulations, I have been designated to come here to Dallas
to take your testimony. Did you receive a letter from the Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I might tell you that under—I don’t know when you received this
letter, but under the rules of the Commission, you are entitled to have 3 days’
written notice, a letter from us 3 days before you appear here to testify, and I
presume that the letter arrived in time so that you have had that notice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Saturday. Now, also the Commission’s rules provide that if
you would like an attorney, that you may be accompanied here by an attorney,
and I notice that you don’t have one.</p>

<p>I did want to acquaint you with this fact, and I presume that since you don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
have one, that you felt you didn’t need one. But if you do feel you would like
a personal attorney, and many of the people who appear do have an attorney,
that is perfectly proper, and in fact it is encouraged by the Commission. But I
take it by your presence without an attorney, that you don’t feel you want one
at the present time.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t think that I would need one. I don’t know anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, I am not suggesting that you would, but I wanted you to
be acquainted.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I am not going to tell anything that is not the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me say this to you, that the Commission has been set up for
the purpose of investigating and evaluating and reporting back to President
Johnson about the assassination of President Kennedy, and about the murder of
Lee Harvey Oswald. We are interested in finding out from you, in particular,
anything you might know in connection with any one of these events.</p>

<p>Of course you have been interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation so
that that is somewhat of a starting point for us. I have had a chance to read
over the reports and I know generally what they have talked to you about. I will
ask you if you have any questions of us before I ask you to be sworn, and then
we can start the deposition.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t have any questions. You just ask me, and I will answer
whatever I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear that
the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you give us your name.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Bertha Cheek.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where do you live, Mrs. Cheek?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. 5901 Hillcrest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It is Mrs. Cheek?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is your husband’s name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I am divorced. Lloyd Cheek.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been divorced from Mr. Cheek?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Approximately 1955 or approximately 1956, I can’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I hate to ask this question of a lady, but when were you born?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. February 9, 1920.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The address you gave us is in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. 5901 Hillcrest, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you lived in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. About 16 or 17 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you live before you lived in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I was born in Troup, Tex., and I was raised in Tyler, and I
moved to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now since you have lived in Dallas, have you met Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I met him on two occasions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you first happen to meet Jack?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. He called me to invest in a nightclub.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Oh, sometime in November, the latter part of November, I think
it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The first time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. The first time I don’t remember. Just what year it might have
been, could have been 1957 or 1958, I don’t know. Whenever he was over here
in the Carousel, and he was trying to sell half of it, and I talked to him about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He owned the Carousel at the time he called you the first time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he want to sell you half of the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you invested in any nightclubs before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No; but I am in the real estate business, and I invest in properties
all the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. How long have you been in the real estate business?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Seventeen years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have a broker’s license?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is the name of your business?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Bertha Cheek. I just go by my own name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you maintain an office any place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. In my home. I usually sell my own property. Buy and sell.
I handle other people’s property at times, but very seldom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of real estate do you handle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Residential real estate, apartments, and houses and lots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many homes or pieces of real estate have you sold outside
of your own real estate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you give us some sort of estimate how many that would be?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I really couldn’t give you an estimate because I don’t know.
It’s been very little.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would it be as many as 10 pieces of real estate other than your
own?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No; not that many.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you own the address that you are presently living in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that a rooming house that you are in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No. I have a couple of rooms rented to SMU students.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you lived at your present address?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I moved there in January. Bought it in August.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. And prior to January—is that of this year, January 1964?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you live prior to January 1964?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Swiss. 3914 Swiss. I have a 10-unit there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You still own that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you own that particular residence? How long
have you owned that particular residence on Swiss Avenue?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Three or four years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. During the 3 or 4 years that you have owned that particular
residence, have you owned any other pieces of property?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Any other places that you rent out rooms?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could you tell us what those were?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. 5430 Gaston; 5310 Gaston; 5212 Gaston; 5302 Gaston; 591—wait
just a minute—5917 Gaston; the Beachcomber and the Holiday Apartments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, where did you live prior to living at the Swiss Avenue
address?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. At the Beachcomber and the Holiday Apartments, Gaston Avenue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall where you were living in 1958?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. 5302 Gaston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now in 1958, what pieces of real estate did you own other than
5308, the one you just mentioned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. 5302.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What pieces of real estate did you own in 1958, other than that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t know. I would have to go back. I have owned quite
a bit of property.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you maintain a set of records as to the property?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. That I own at the present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or that you have owned over the years?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. On the courthouse records, just to go down and check.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about rental records for those places that you have rented
out rooms and suites, do you maintain records for those?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How far back do your records go?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I have them back to 1947.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We haven’t asked you to bring any records.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Not down here, I couldn’t bring them all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am wondering <span class="locked">if——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. The man went through those records at the house. I let them
go all through whatever they wanted to when they came out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The Federal Bureau of Investigation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes. And I told them what connection I had in connection
with Jack Ruby. He asked me to put $6,000 in a nightclub.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am wondering if I could ask you if you will make those records
available again?</p>

<p>I think what I would like to do is ask one of the Secret Service agents to
go out there and either make some arrangements to photocopy them and then
return them to you, or else if it would be more convenient to let me look at
them for some short period of time, and then return them to you. I think I
would prefer to photocopy them, unless they are voluminous and it would be
prohibitive. I think I would only be going back to January 1959.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Those two men went through everything I had and looked at it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you object if <span class="locked">I——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. It is just an awful lot of trouble for me right now because I
am very busy and I have illness in my home. If I thought I could help you,
and really if there is anything there, I would bring them down myself to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I would like to do this in a way that would be least inconvenient.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. But I don’t know Oswald and I just knew Jack Ruby when he
asked me to invest $6,000 and I didn’t do it. I didn’t like the way he wanted
me to invest. He wanted to put in $1,000, and me $6,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What would be the least inconvenient way to do this? If
perhaps all the books are in one place, we could get the books from January 1,
1959, on to the present and photocopy them in a day and then return them to you.
Would that be convenient?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I have them stored, is the only thing. I have a lot of things in
front, and it is difficult in digging it out, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I suppose really—is there going to be anytime in the next week
or so that would be more convenient for you than any other time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I really don’t know of anything else. My daughter has cancer.
She may be well and she may not be, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you this. Would you retain these records, and
sometime during the next month, let me ask one of the agents to contact you
again in connection with getting copies of them for us, and you could work
out at that time what would be most convenient to you. If you don’t like
it that way, then suggest it some other way, because I want to do this some
way that would be least inconvenient to you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Well, you are welcome to come to see them again as far as
that is concerned, but I don’t want to let them go out of my hands. I am not
going to let them go from me, because if some of those things are missing, it is
my fault. The men can come out there any time and look them over if they
want to look them over and take pictures or whatever they may want to do,
or copy them all off. They can come out there and just copy every name
that I have ever had or ever rented to from the time of 1947, if they would like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If this were done at your home, that would be the best so far
as you are concerned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes; I will have to go get them. I never have moved them
from Swiss Avenue, and they are in the storage house. I will have to go over
and get them and bring them over to Hillcrest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many different boxes are we talking about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Everything I have ever owned, I guess is what I was going
to give you. That is what I did before. Every record I have, every name
that I ever rented to, I give it to the men that was out there and you may have
them now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am sure we don’t want to go back that far. Well, let me
see what we can work out, with the Secret Service or the Bureau, and then I
will either contact you myself about it or I will ask someone of the agents to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
do it, and I think it could be done fairly simply. I know in the past that
photographers can set the camera on a kitchen table and run these things
through. I take it then when Jack Ruby contacted you in connection with
buying out a part of the Carousel Club, that he got your name from somebody?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I was looking at a piece of property over on Maple Avenue
when Olen Alexander or Bob Shockley, two more agents called me about buying
the place myself. I went over to look at the building and they asked me
what would go in the building, and I think a nice nightclub, it is in the neighborhood
like it would, so I guess they gave it to Jack Ruby because when I mentioned
the nightclub, because I said I might even invest in it myself, I was
so sold on it, so Jack Ruby called me and asked me if I would invest in it.
Not this particular piece of property. He didn’t tell me where he had this
location, but I just know that that was how he got my name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, are we talking about your most recent discussion with
Jack or the first one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let’s talk about the first time you contacted Jack.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. He had it for sale.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He had the Carousel for sale?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes; and I had someone that was interested in a night club,
so I went down to see about it, see how much he would sell it for, and he said
$12,500. I said that was too much. My conversation was very short, and I
left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, you met him at the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was anybody with him at that time? Anybody else at this
meeting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. There was activity all in there. I don’t know who the people
were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did anybody accompany you in connection with this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes; I think Mrs. Davidson went down with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Davidson? What is her first name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Lula B. Davidson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does she live here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where does she live?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Over on Normandy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is she in the real estate business?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No. She was a schoolteacher of mine. Just happened to be
at the house when I started to go down, and I asked her if she would like to
go. She taught me in school in Tyler, Tex. I don’t think that she would remember
too much about it, because it was such a—just went down with me. It
wasn’t a real big issue made, and I said, “Would you like to go with me to see
about a nightclub,” and she said, “Yes; I would.” So I just walked up and
talked to Jack Ruby and asked him how much he wanted for the club’s half interest,
and he said $12,500, and I left because I didn’t think it was worth it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had Jack had an advertisement in the newspaper about this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you first called Jack, what did he tell you when
you talked to him over the telephone that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t remember the exact words. I usually tell people when
I contact them about business, I would like to meet them in their office or in
their place of business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you make an appointment and go down? You didn’t talk
to him about what he wanted or what kind of property he had over the telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No; didn’t make any discussion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack’s ad indicate he was selling the full interest, or half
interest?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Half, and he wanted a partner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So you would have been a partner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No; I wouldn’t. When I invest, I make a corporation out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
it, or someone else operates the business for me. That is the way the rooming
houses; I have managers in them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack talk to you about how much he was making off of
this business?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No. He might have talked to me about that, but I don’t remember
the exact figures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you come to the conclusion that his price was too
high?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I just thought it was too high. I could build a club for that.
I know the prices of material.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Jack was only interested in selling an interest in the real
estate at that time, or was he interested in <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. The business. He didn’t have the real estate. He didn’t have
the building. It was just the business he was selling half interest in it. I
could buy a place for that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So you would have been interested in the profitability of Jack’s
particular business?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No; not his particular business. I didn’t know what kind of
club he was operating out there. I thought it was a dance place and cocktail
lounge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But in order to determine whether the twelve thousand price
was too high and you weren’t going to get any real estate out of it, you were
going to share in the profits from the club, you would have to know something
about how much money he was making off the club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t remember how much he was making.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You did talk to him; didn’t you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes; I talked to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He said he wanted $12,500 for half of the business?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I didn’t look at the books. I didn’t even go into that because
I didn’t want to put $12,500 into that kind of club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you talk to him on this occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. It wasn’t very long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk to him for 3 hours?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I just don’t know how long I talked to him the first time, because
it’s been so long ago. But the last time I stayed down there, I think, an hour
or so or 3. It might have been 3 hours or 2 hours, because he brought in this
other fellow named Frank, his interior decorator, or that decorated the club,
and I talked to him, and he was telling me what a nice fellow he was, because
I didn’t know Jack Ruby very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Frank’s name Frank Fisher? Do you remember that
name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No; I don’t know. He just kept referring to him as Frank.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know whether this fellow was in business for himself
or whether he worked with somebody, this Frank fellow?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever hear the name of whom he might have been
employed by?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now as I understand it, Jack at this particular time got your
name through somebody, a fellow by the name of Alexander, or another fellow
that you talked to in connection with buying a club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Olen Alexander.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was the club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t know that to be the truth, but I just thought that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was the club that you were looking at?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. It wasn’t a club. It was a building that they were showing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was that located?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. On Maple.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you ever had an interest in any nightclub or dancehall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About what time of the day or night was it that you met with
Jack this last occasion?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. 2 o’clock in the evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In the afternoon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This was at the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes; in his office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When Jack called you, what did he say to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Said he had a business deal that he wanted to talk over with
me. I said, “What kind is it?”</p>

<p>And he said, “A club.” And asked me to come down to talk to him about it,
and I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he indicate at the time he called you how much money he
wanted you to invest?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now when you got down there to talk to him, what did he say
and what did you say? Try to recall as best you can how this conversation was.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. He said he had a location for a club and he wanted me to put
in $6,000 and he’d put $1,000 and he would use his talent and ability to operate
a club, and he knew really how to run one and operate one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he indicate what sort of return he expected?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Fifty-fifty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Each would have a half interest in the club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he indicate how much of a return you would make for
your $6,000?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No; he didn’t. He couldn’t even tell me the location of the
place, because I asked him that, kept questioning him about where is the
location, and he didn’t want to tell me that. And I asked him why, and he
said, “Well, he just couldn’t tell me right then.” And I said, “Is it because
you think I might go around and sell this place or try to buy it myself?” And
he said, “Yes, that is the reason.”</p>

<p>He said, “How would you do about anything like that?” And I said, “Well,
you tie it up. Put some money up on it.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did it sound like Jack was interested in buying a piece of real
estate, or was he going to get a lease and operate in a leased building, or what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. He didn’t go into that. He just kept talking about how he could
operate a club, how much money could be made, you know, and he introduced
me to this other fellow and talked about what a good interior decorator he
was and how he would decorate the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did the interior decorator say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Then the man was telling me what a good operator he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he tell you anything about his experience in other places
he decorated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes; one or two places; but I really didn’t pay any attention
to what locations. I was just listening to Mr. Ruby on what his deal was on
the investment I was supposed to make, and whether or not I would like it or
not, and I told him I could manage a business, too. And I said, “I don’t think
that I would want to go in with anyone and put $6,000 and you put $1,000.
You would have to come fifty-fifty.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did Jack indicate was his response?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. He said he couldn’t do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could you tell from his response whether he meant that he
didn’t want to do it or that he couldn’t afford to do it, or what he meant by that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Well, he did say he didn’t have the money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he say he didn’t have the money?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now had you inquired about Jack Ruby from other people?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You mean now you only met him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I had heard people talk about Jack Ruby, but I didn’t inquire
about him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it other people that you know had told you things about
Jack Ruby?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes. I have heard people talk about him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What had you heard about Jack prior to the time you went to
talk to him about this club where he wouldn’t tell you where it was located?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I haven’t heard anything except he ran the Carousel Club and
was a good operator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You had heard what kind of businessman he was? How well
he ran his business?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you heard whether he was honest or dishonest?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you tell us what you heard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I just knew he run a club and I heard people say that he was a
good operator, and I figured if he was a good operator and made money, he must
have been a good businessman. You don’t make money unless you are a good
operator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall who it was that told you Jack was a good operator?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t recall right off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it you had the impression that Jack was able to make
money off of his operations?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, do any of your friends or acquaintances or tenants know
Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall at all who it might have been that had known
Jack well enough to tell you that he was running his business well?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I think it was a policeman that had rented from me that I had
talked to occasionally and said something about Jack Ruby’s place. I don’t
know just who it was that told me, and their name. I would be talking to
someone sometime, and I can’t remember their names to save my life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was the name of the policeman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you had a number of policemen rent from you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I think Mr. Olson said something—I am not sure of the name—on
the police force. I wouldn’t like to say anything else unless I know for
sure I can give the exact name and address. I just heard this conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. <span class="locked">Well——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. See.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did the police officer whose name might have been Olson,
when did he rent from you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Beachcomber in 1961 or 1960, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did he continue to rent from you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t think he rented there very long, 3 or 4 months. But
this was after. Let’s see, no, it wasn’t after. That was after the first time I
had met him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, other than Mr. Olson, you don’t know of anybody else of
your acquaintances or tenants who knew Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No. You know, his name has been in the paper and his advertising;
and I am sure a lot of people had heard about him and go to the club,
but I had never gone to the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now did your husband know Jack Ruby? Mr. Cheek, did he
know Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No. I don’t know whether he did or not. He may know Jack
Ruby because he is a National Cash Register man downtown that fixes all
of the cash registers. He might have gone up and worked on a cash register.
I really don’t know. I haven’t asked him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The FBI talked with you sometime ago. I believe you indicated
that you had some recollection that some Cubans had rented from you
back in 1959, two Cubans had rented from you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t know just exactly what was said on that, whether they
got that off of the books or whether my sister had told them about it, that
rented to Oswald over on Beckley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Mrs. Roberts or Miss Roberts—Mrs. <span class="locked">Roberts—</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Miss?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Mrs. Roberts. I don’t know whether she told me about that or
if they got it off the book, or whether I had rented to a Cuban. I think one
or two, and also Dr. Florescent of the Philippine Islands.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Tell us what recollection you have of the Cubans that you rented
to.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t remember them because I had managers in there. I
wouldn’t know them personally myself at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to hand you, Mrs. Cheek, a document which consists of
3 pages, and it purports to be an interview report prepared by two agents of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mr. Barry and Mr. Kelley. This is supposed
to have been a copy of a report of interview which they had with you
on November 27, 1963. Maybe if you will look this over, you may recall it is
reported in here that at that time—I will read it:</p>

<p>“That she recalled having rented to two Cuban males, in 1959 or 1960, but
could provide no other information concerning them.” Why don’t you take your
time and read that whole thing over, because I am interested in finding out
whether the whole report is an accurate report of that interview.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I owned this boarding house at 5212 Gaston since 1948 to about
1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What does it say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. It says 1956 to 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You want to take Miss Laidrich’s pen and make a change there
to reflect the period that you actually owned that boarding house, the actual
period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. [Makes correction.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you sold it in 1961?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I think that is about the date that I sold it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you want to initial that change there that you made and put
a date by it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. [Initials and dates.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This is 4-14-64. Why don’t you go ahead and take your time
to read it through and make any other corrections.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I have got to go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mrs. Cheek has indicated that her daughter is in the hospital
and she told me earlier, and would like to recess this. Perhaps we can set
another time to continue it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I thought that I was only going to be here about 15 minutes,
and I was supposed to talk to the doctor about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don’t want to keep you then. How would Thursday be?
Would you be able to come back at any time on Thursday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Could I give you any other kind of information on my records
or what else do you want me to tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Actually, if you could bring with <span class="locked">you——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I can’t bring all those records down here. They are welcome to
go out to the house and make a copy of every name I ever rented to, but I
can’t bring them all down here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, suppose we handle it this way.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. They were welcome that day I gave them every record I had,
and I told them they could copy all the names down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Suppose we contact one of the agents and have somebody photograph
these records, and then perhaps next Monday, why we could resume the
deposition and I could look through the records with you here and the copies
that we have photographed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Do I have to come back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, because I would like to talk to you about the statements
and get any changes that you care to make in the statements, and complete the
topic we are talking about here.</p>

<p>I hate to inconvenience you like this.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Well, if I could do you any good, I would be happy to, but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
don’t know how I could, because I don’t know Jack Ruby or Oswald very well.
In fact, I didn’t know Oswald at all, and I didn’t know Ruby well enough to help
you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, any little bit that we can learn can be helpful to us. But
I would like to set it up in a way that wouldn’t interfere with your problems at
home. I think they are substantial. Why don’t you name the day and the time.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I can’t name the date and the time. I don’t know. I didn’t
expect my daughter to be ill when she was. I only thought she was going to
the hospital two days.</p>

<p>I work in real estate. I don’t know when I have appointments, and I am trying
to sell the place on Hillcrest. I have an appointment this afternoon with the
minister out there or one of the men of the church, not the minister, but to try
to sell Hillcrest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, the mornings, I take it, are better for you than the afternoons?
Why don’t we make it Monday morning. If 9 o’clock, isn’t too early for
you, we will start at 9.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. How much longer do you think it would take on this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don’t think it would take more than a half hour, but sometimes
it takes time to have you sit here and read through these statements and point
out any corrections or changes or additions that you would have to make, and
it could take half an hour to an hour, especially if we get these photographs of
the records.</p>

<p>Then we can clarify these on these records. Do you remember which apartment
it was that the Cubans lived in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. That was 5212 Gaston. I think the front room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Maybe if we could just get those records copied. Do you
remember what year it was that they—you believe it was 1959 or 1960, when
you went through those records with the agents? Were you able to pinpoint
those to Cubans who you had there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No. I don’t think so. They were looking at the names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So I suppose it would be best if we just got the records since,
say, January 1, 1958 to make sure we cover everything, and that would be 1958
through 1961.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I think so. That is when I sold the place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, up until the sale. Now, do you recall if these two men
ever came back and lived in any other place that you owned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I wouldn’t know, because I told you I had managers in my
apartment houses and my rooming houses. They did the renting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Sometimes I rented to people, <span class="locked">but——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If we started with January 1, 1958 and got all the records up to
the present, how many records, how high a stack of records would we be talking
about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t know how high.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many different apartments would we be talking about since
January 1958?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I would just have to go back and look, because I buy and sell all
the time and trade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would it be as many as 10?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Could have been more than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could it have been more than that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes. Not places, but apartments. See, I had a 32-unit in Oak
Cliff, and there was 46 in the Beachcomber Apartments. Then there was people
that rented on Gaston Avenue, but see, I just traded back and forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many different buildings did you own since 1958?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I really don’t know. You’d just have to go down at the courthouse
and look. I would have to figure it out. 3518 Gillespie, I sold it though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Maybe what we should do is take 1958 to 1961, and then simply
the year 1963, so that we will take 1958 to 1961, for that Gaston building, and we
will take 1963 for all these buildings. How many buildings did you own last
year, in 1963?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. 1963, I think 3914 Swiss. I didn’t own some of these buildings
all the year. I bought and sold and traded, so I would just have to go into all of
that.</p>

<p>I sold it in August. And then maybe I sold 3518 Gillespie. I think I sold it
in November. I don’t remember just the dates that I closed on the property
and sell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, I think that would simplify it because we would like, if
we can identify these two particular individuals, and it is possible since they
lived with you before, they might have moved back into another one that you
own.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. They went over all those records, those men did out there. Mr.
Kelley and Mr. Barry, I thought his name was Barrett. That is what he introduced
himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Whatever it is down there, Barry.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I thought he said Barrett.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Barry is what is written there anyhow.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. (Reads reports of interviews.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How would Monday morning at 9 or 9:30 be?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. If you don’t think it would be very much longer, I think I have
missed the doctor, because I have been here an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, since we are going to try to get these records, I would
almost rather do it with the records, so if there was something with the records,
I wouldn’t have to call you again, unless you are willing to take a chance on
that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Aren’t they coming out to the house to take the names down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I think it would be easier if they went out with a camera and
photographed that. All right, would you prefer to complete it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. If it wouldn’t take too much longer. I have an appointment at 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It shouldn’t take anywhere near that long.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I guess I have missed my appointment with the doctor. I
wanted to talk to him about my daughter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you want to call him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. May I call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. (Makes telephone call.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mrs. Cheek, have you had a chance to read over what I have
marked as Cheek Exhibit No. 5353? It is a three-page report marked 456, 457
and 458, of Commission’s Document No. 205, which purports to be a report of an
interview which FBI Agents Barry and Kelley had with you on November 27.</p>

<p>Have you had a chance to read that over?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I thought that I read all of this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are there any additions or corrections or changes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. This is all approximate. I wouldn’t know. I couldn’t swear that
everything was right down to the figure, but that is the best of my knowledge
about everything.</p>

<p>They have $12,000 down there. I thought I remember $12,500 he wanted, but
that may have been another piece of property I was thinking about. I don’t
remember the exact figure.</p>

<p>Now on the sale, that was what I was talking about. They had $12,000. I
told you today I thought $12,500 is what he wanted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it you weren’t able to get a hold of the doctor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But other than that, you don’t feel that you would make any substantial
changes in this? What I am directing myself to is whether this report
is an accurate report of what you told them at that time?</p>

<p>I realize that there may have been things that you will recall that you didn’t
recall then, but as far as this report being accurate as to what you told them
at that time, I take it you are satisfied that it is accurate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I think it is. I might remember something there that I don’t
remember now. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now you indicated that you recall having rented to two Cuban<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
males in 1959 and 1960. I understand that these two Cubans were living at
5212 Gaston?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does that apartment have a name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How <span class="locked">big——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. It wasn’t an apartment. It was a boarding house; room and
board.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many rooms did you rent out there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I think it was about 10 rooms that I rented out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who managed that boarding house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I had different managers throughout the year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, now, in the period 1959 and 1960, who was managing it
for you at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I would have to look back on my records. Nineteen what, now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. 1959 or 1960?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I would have to look back, because managers for boarding houses
is like waitresses and cooks, they come and go because you don’t pay them very
much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall when your sister, Mrs. Roberts, was working at or
managing your boarding houses?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Not the exact date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall whether she was managing any boarding house for
you back in 1959 or 1960?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. She might have been at 5430. You would have to ask her. I
believe you would have a more correct answer on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there anything that makes you recall that the two Cubans
lived at 5212?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t know right now just what brought that up or anything.
Now my son was there, I think, while the two FBI men were there, and he
might have mentioned it, or my sister might have mentioned it, I don’t remember.
There were two Cubans there, I think. They might have been Cuban and
they might not have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What made you think they were Cubans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t know how they got that they were Cubans, because I
don’t know a Cuban from a Spanish or a Spanish from a Mexican. Like Dr.
Florescent, when he come in, he was real dark. I wasn’t going to rent because
I don’t rent to dark Spanish people or Mexicans or Indians. I always rented
to light-colored people my own race. But another color, and he was so well
dressed and everything and he insisted—this is in 1948, I think. He came in
there from the Philippine Islands. He was going to Baylor Hospital to school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about the two Cubans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t really know if I would know they were Cubans or not
unless someone told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it that it is unusual to have somebody living at your
place who is of Spanish or Latin American background?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. That it would be what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It would be unusual for you to rent to someone who was Spanish
or Latin American or of Cuban background?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No, it wouldn’t be unusual, because I had rented to people from
Mexico at the Beachcomber, very nice people, when I had short rentals there.
They checked in; they were business people; and I had rented to people from,
not China, but the Japs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Japanese?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes, at the Beachcomber, during the fair. The pearl dealers,
I rented to, but on short rentals. And there were just a few that I had a short
time at the Beachcomber and I had a set up of maid service and television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When somebody comes in to rent one of the suites, do they
contact you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I had managers there, and sometimes I would be there at the
Beachcomber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you given your managers instructions as to the kind of
people that they should rent to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Well, they always know what kind of business they are in or
something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, can you describe these two people that you thought might
have been Cuban?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t remember them too well. In fact, I don’t know why
they have Cuban down there, because I would have to talk with him again.
When they were going over those <span class="locked">records——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did they <span class="locked">rent——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I know there were some people there, either from, they might
have been Mexico or Cuban.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did they rent the same suite?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. This is not an apartment. This is 5212 Gaston. This is the
rooming house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did each of them have a separate room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No, they both stayed in the same room. In, I think, the front
part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In the front part of the house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did they stay?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t remember. Just take my records and look at them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it when you went through these records with the agents,
did you <span class="locked">see——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes, I probably saw those names and I recognized it by that
or something. I don’t remember just exactly how I remembered right at that
time, because I was trying to remember everything I could all the way back to
try to tell them everything I knew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. These two fellows, were they fat or thin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. They were small, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did they appear to be men in their 20’s or 30’s or 40’s or 50’s?</p>

<p>How old would you say they were?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. The two boys that were in the front room at 5212 Gaston were
younger fellows.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Under 25, would you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did they speak English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t know. I guess they speak it very well, enough to get
in. I never rented to anyone that couldn’t speak English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did they speak with a noticeable accent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did they appear to have a job of any sort?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t remember. I am just trying to remember all, you know.
That is a long time back, and renting to so many people, you don’t pay that much
attention to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How often did you have occasion to talk with them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I never do talk to people unless they talk to me about something
about the business, or the room, or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. These two fellows, do you recall ever talking to them on any
occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I can’t remember holding a conversation with them, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You indicated that your son was present when the Agents Barry
and Kelley interviewed you. Did he have some recollection of these two Cubans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. John might have. I think John was there. I believe he was,
or Irwin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. These are both your sons?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is their last name Cheek or Cheeks?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Cheek.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How old is John?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. He is 18.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how about Irwin?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Thirteen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now you also indicated in your first report that you had been
acquainted with Jack Ruby since 1948. What makes you place that date?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. They asked me—when, 1948?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; that is what they reported here.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I didn’t say 1948. I bought the house in 1948, and it might have
been 1956. They have that 1956 down there of me buying 5212 Gaston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I didn’t meet Jack Ruby in 1948. 1948 is when I bought 5212.
They have the dates mixed up there.</p>

<p>And then 1956 or 1957, I might have went down there to the club, but I don’t
think I knew him in 1948, at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This report also indicates that you formerly operated night clubs
in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No; I told them that I went down and operated a club, just managed
a club for Frank and Virginia Nick on Browder Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was the name of that night club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Pat Morgan had the club at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was the name of the club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Club Royal is what Virginia and Frank Nick named it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. R-o-y-a-l?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that the name of the club when you were employed there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. February of 1963, I believe it was, this past year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But prior to 1963, had you ever been connected with the night
club business in any way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No; nothing, only my husband was a musician. He played
nightclubs and I went there with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he play in Dallas nightclubs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this Mr. Cheek?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you a performer or anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long was he a musician in Dallas? For what period of
time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. He was a musician before I married him. He just had it as a
hobby. He worked at National Cash Register, and played on Friday and Saturday
nights to pick up extra money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see; you came to Dallas, you said, 18 years ago? 1946?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. 1947.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. 1947. Were you married to Mr. Cheek at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you marry Mr. Cheek?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. 1947.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, from 1947 to 1955, did Mr. Cheek play these weekend
jobs in nightclubs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he employed regularly on weekends?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. He played with Harry Traveler’s Band, and I don’t remember the
other names of the bands he played with, but he might have set in on some.
You would have to ask him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he ever play in any of Jack Ruby’s clubs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So your connection with the night club business prior to 1963,
was solely through your husband’s association as a musician and your going to
the night clubs with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you used to go regularly on the nights that he played?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Most every Saturday night or Friday with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you indicated here also that on the last occasion that you
saw Jack Ruby at the Carousel Club, that you spent several hours discussing
this investment with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I think I put down there two or three hours. About 2 until
maybe 4:30, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can’t you give us any more idea about what he had for this
club, what kind of club it was going to be? You said you talked with the
interior decorator?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I let him talk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t remember all they said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can’t you tell us some more about what he said? You were
there for a couple of hours. He must have <span class="locked">described——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. He talked to other people while I was there. He would go in
and out of the office, and he would indicate to me he was talking long distance
and talking to other people that come in his club. And then he would come
back and talk some more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he make any long distance telephone calls while you were
there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes; but I don’t know when he made them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he hold these conversations in his office?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. He was in the office, and then in the club, and then he came a
few minutes, and then I came on home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Your best recollection is, it was from about 2 o’clock in the
afternoon until about sometime after 4:00 that afternoon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you happen to place the time? Anything significant?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I think it was; I remember the time I was down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It was a 2 o’clock appointment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes. Around 2:00 or 2:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember how many long distance telephone calls he
made?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he talk to you about any of the business enterprises that
he had?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. He told me about other businesses he had and how many he
had been in, but I don’t remember exactly. I just listened to him and I wasn’t
interested really in putting in $6,000 and him putting in $1,000, and I was
just listening to the man talk and getting his ideas on a lot of things that he
had in mind for clubs that he was talking about, and I didn’t I wasn’t really
interested in what he did in the past or what clubs he was connected with.
That is why I don’t remember, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You also indicated that you thought at first when you saw
Lee Harvey Oswald’s photograph on television, that you might have rented
to him. What made you think that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I noticed a lot of people you can walk down the street or be
introduced to a person and think I have met them before. Well, I was trying
to remember back if I had ever seen the man before in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you think you might have seen him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I didn’t know. Just like have you ever, you know, met a person
and thought you had seen them before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Well, that is the way I thought I was trying to remember
where I had seen him before, and probably I had seen him so many times
on TV that day until I thought maybe I had rented to him, and I thought if
I had, I would look it up and turn it in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you this. Where were you when you first heard
that President Kennedy had been shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. In my apartment at 3914 Swiss, Apartment 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. What did I do that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, Ma’am.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I was waiting for the plumber to fix some plumbing there at the
apartment house. That is where I was living. I don’t remember all the things
I did that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you remain there all day and watch TV all day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I just turned it on when the plumber wanted—he said the
President is in the city and he said, “Let’s look at TV a little,” he said, “I
haven’t listened to any of the news.”</p>

<p>So his name is Louis Zmolik and I turned on the TV.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you continue to watch television the rest of the day, or
did you go back to your business?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Watched it off and on. I was answering the phone, talking on
the phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember if there were business calls that you had or
social calls, or talking with people about the assassination, or what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Well, they might have been business calls, some of them and
some I was talking about how terrible it was the President had been killed,
what an awful thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did your sister call you that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No; I don’t think she did. I didn’t learn that, I think, until
someone else called me to watch TV, that she had been on TV. I didn’t see
her on TV.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did your sister appear? Was she interviewed on Television?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Someone said that she was, and my sister in Tyler said she was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see her interviewed on TV?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No; I didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What day was that? Was that on Friday, the day the President
was killed, or was it on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. The President, I think, was killed wasn’t he, on the 22d of
November, Washington’s Birthday? I remembered that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The 22d of February is Washington’s birthday.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I mean November.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It was Friday, the 22d.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that the day that Mrs. Roberts appeared on television,
or was it a later date?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t know. I never did see her on TV.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about the next day on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I got the newspaper and saw the next morning, I think, where
her picture was in the paper, but I didn’t talk to her until—yes, she called me,
my sister called me on Swiss Avenue. I have a sister living on Swiss. She
called me and told me, I think, that Earlene was on TV, and we talked the next
morning about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now on Saturday, do you recall what you did on Saturday
the 23d?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Sure can’t, not right off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you spend all day watching television?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No; I didn’t spend all day watching TV. I just happened to
turn on the TV because Mr. Zmolik asked me to turn on the TV that day. I
don’t know what I was doing. I was probably cleaning the house, because
I didn’t have a maid.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it you were probably in and out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes; cleaning the apartment, and sometimes I even cleaned the
apartments myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Sunday morning, the 24th, do you recall what you
were doing the morning of the 24th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall when it was you first learned that Jack Ruby
had shot Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to hand you what I have marked “Dallas, Texas, 4-14-64,
Bertha Cheek, Exhibit 5354.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
This consists of two pages of an interview report which is marked Commission’s
Document 86, Page 132, and 80, Page 133.</p>

<p>It is a copy of a report made by Special Agent David Barry of the FBI,
with you, Mrs. Cheek, on December 9, 1963.</p>

<p>I want you to read that over and I will ask you the same questions with
respect to that as I asked with the previous report. That is, would you make
any additions or corrections on that?</p>

<p>If you felt that that is an accurate report of the interview you had with
Agent Barry?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I had bought and sold in the nightclubs, no. I didn’t say
that. I didn’t mean to give them the impression, if they got that impression,
that I had bought and sold nightclubs. No. I told them about Maple Avenue,
you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me see what portion of the report you are referring to.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t remember buying and selling nightclubs, but I would,
if I could make any money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This report says on Page 132; “Mrs. Cheek stated that she has
been in the real estate business in Dallas, Texas, for a number of years.”</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. “That she frequently has bought and sold interests in nightclubs;
that during the past several months she has been attempting to locate
a good nightclub investment; and that in this connection she had visited
practically every nightclub in Dallas which she considered might be purchased
outright or in which an interest might be obtained.”</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I was interested in buying one, but I hadn’t bought and sold them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So the only change you would make in the paragraph was to
strike out that clause which reads, “that she frequently has bought and sold
interests in nightclubs”?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you want to take this pen and put a line through that
and initial it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. [Complies.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why don’t you go ahead and continue to read it and tell us
if there are any other changes that you would make?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. [Reading report.]</p>

<p>Mr. Martin knows Jack Ruby. That name right there, that man might have
told Jack Ruby that I was interested in a club. He knows him real well and says
Mrs. Grant is his friend, and Jack Ruby, that is the time that I made the
appointment to see him about the club.</p>

<p>Well, he said that he had had dinner with Jack Ruby. We were talking about
the club over on Oak Lawn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes. And he said Jack Ruby was a good friend of his. And
he told me about Jack Ruby. That is where I got my information, I remember
now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You talked with him about Ruby. When was your conversation
with Martin about Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. He was just telling me about a good operator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. And how he made money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long before you saw Ruby in November?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Just before I went down to the club, you know, and met him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He said something to you also about Mrs. Grant, Eva Grant?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Mr. Martin. He said both were good friends of him, and said
Mrs. Grant operated the club on Oak Lawn for Mr. Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember anything else he told you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t remember all the conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you call this Mr. Martin that said he had dinner with
Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes; he was a real good friend of his and a real nice fellow,
and Mr. Martin said he was in the oil business and he was just kind of playing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
with that club over there because he liked the nightclub business, and he
wanted $25,000 for half interest in it, and I thought it was too much money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you happen to know Martin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Just looking for clubs, and I saw Mr. Martin’s. I found out
who owned the club. I don’t remember just how I found out who owned a place.
Sometimes I might go down to the records, if they buy the land, and look to
see who owns it. Then I contact them like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now didn’t you plan to manage this club yourself? Any club that
you would buy, didn’t you plan on managing it yourself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t know whether I would or not, or whether I would have
someone else to manage it for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much of a return did you expect on your investment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I wasn’t thinking about that at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You must have some idea.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I didn’t know how much I would invest. I didn’t have very
much money to invest. I would have to trade a piece of property or sell a
piece. I was looking for clubs or property. If you are talking to people you
run into a good bit—buying 5212 Gaston, I put down $600 down, but I paid high
payments. I don’t know how much I would invest. I don’t have a whole lot of
money. I put small payments down and make high payments a month, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Sure, but you want to make sure you are getting more money
off your real estate or business investments?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. When I came to Dallas, I didn’t have very much money. I
started managing a place for Mrs. Strong out on Gaston Avenue, and I managed
it for her, and she sold me the place for $600 earnest money down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is the money that you acquired, you use for buying and selling
real estate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Buying and selling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you obtain any money from your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No; we worked together those years. He didn’t take anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But all the money which was accumulated by you was accumulated
through your own efforts?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. And other people working for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, when you think about investing money, you decide whether
you are going to put that money into some business or whether you are going
to leave it in a bank and draw three or four percent interest, don’t you? Don’t
you have any idea?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I never have enough to leave in the bank to draw interest. I
either have it invested or going to invest it, what little I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Don’t you ever figure this out in terms of percentage you get
or you expect to get on the money that you put up?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No; I haven’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you decide whether it is going to be a good investment
for you or not? Whether it is the kind of investment that you want?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I really don’t know. I just trade and sell. That is all I do.
I guess I should figure more. Maybe that is why I lost all I did in the Beachcomber,
because I just traded that today. I trade 5212 and 5302 for the Beachcomber
and the Holiday Apartments on a contract to sell, and probably had I
gotten a paper and pencil and had an attorney, I wouldn’t have done that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, is there anything else as you read through that, that you
want to change?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. [Reading.] You know, you talk to people about investments like
Jack Ruby, but I have talked to a number of people. You may not just have
an idea that you would invest, if you would make some money. I had no idea
that I would. This is nothing permanent about this at all. I was just talking
to the people, just went down and talked to him just like I talked to Bill Martin.
Bill Martin could have killed President Kennedy and it would have been the
same thing when I talked to him if he did it.</p>

<p>I was so surprised when I heard that Jack Ruby killed Oswald and all this
happened, it just floored me. I thought it was the awfulest thing I had ever
heard of. I didn’t figure that man doing such a thing, after talking to him down
there. He didn’t seem like a criminal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of man did he seem like?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. He seemed like a, well, he was kind of a nervous person, but
you wouldn’t have thought that he would murder anyone. He just walked
around, you know, but I am a nervous person myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he able to keep the conversation going in the same general
direction? Was he flighty?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Kind of flighty; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did he act?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Well, he didn’t know his location. And I told him it seemed to
me that it was funny why he would try to get $6,000 out of me, not knowing, I
wouldn’t know the location, I wouldn’t know anything about the business or
anything.</p>

<p>He couldn’t tell me anything about that, and I didn’t understand why he would
call me down and try to convince me he was a good man and talking for this
Frank, too, and not having the location, couldn’t show me what I was buying.
And I told him I usually see the things that I buy or know something about it.
I don’t buy anything unless I can see it and look at it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you get the idea that this Frank <span class="locked">was——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. He is an older fellow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How old a man did he appear to be?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I would say he was up around 66 years old. He was gray-headed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About how tall was he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. He was a little taller than I was. About five seven, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But not a tall man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about his weight? Appear to be heavy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t remember how much the man weighed, about 165 or 160,
maybe not that much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he appear to be a fat man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Medium-built, would you say, or skinny?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. He wasn’t skinny, I don’t think. I didn’t look at the man really
that much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall if he wore glasses?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t know whether he did or not. I don’t think he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you learn anything about where he lived?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack Ruby indicate that somebody else besides Fisher and
he were interested in this new nightclub?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or Frank, whatever his name is?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I didn’t understand that Frank was going in on it. He was going
to decorate it for Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack indicate there was somebody else interested besides
him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Just himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You must have been quite annoyed with him when he wouldn’t
tell you where it would be and wouldn’t give you the details?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Well, I just told him I couldn’t make an investment that I didn’t
know about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he describe how big it was going to be? How many seats?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No, he didn’t. He might have, but I don’t remember the exact
seating.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then you can’t tell us anything that you recall about that conversation
other than what you have told us so far?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. That is all I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. Now, have you read through this interview report?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t have glasses, and I can’t see too well today. I don’t have
my glasses with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, would you like me to read it out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. You can read it to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you read the first paragraph?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I think I read pretty well through everything, because I can hold
it off and read it pretty good. I was holding it. I can see if I hold it far away.
If you want, you can read it to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why don’t I start to read at the last paragraph on page 132 of
Commission Document 86. It reads: “At Ruby’s invitation, Mrs. Cheek said
she did discuss such investment with Ruby at the Carousel. Ruby proposed her
investment of $6,000 in a club, the identity or location of which he would not
disclose, apparently Mrs. Cheek said to preclude her going around him on the
deal.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Cheek said she would not consider the investment of $6,000 without full
disclosure and had suggested to Ruby that he get an option on the business so
that he might discuss the proposal openly. This concluded the discussion of
such investment by Mrs. Cheek with Jack Ruby.”</p>

<p>Let me ask you at this point, was your understanding that this was a going
business that he was going to buy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No, it was the location that he was going to buy and then put
the club in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So it really means that he should get an option on the real estate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes. That is what I told him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. “Throughout these discussions at the Carousel, Mrs. Cheek
stated that Ruby was assisted by one Frank, whose last name Mrs. Cheek did
not recall.</p>

<p>“She described Frank as a man of Jewish extraction about 60 years of age with
gray hair. Frank was present, she said, apparently to provide Ruby with a
good recommendation as a nightclub operator as this was the extent of his
participation in the discussion.”</p>

<p>You would amplify that to say that Frank also talked about how Frank was
going to decorate the place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. He didn’t tell that he was going to decorate this place. He talked
about how he decorated the other place and how nice a job he did. And he
spoke of how, what a good operator Ruby was in the nightclub business and how
he could make money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then the last sentence is:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Cheek was unable to provide any additional information of pertinence
concerning Jack Ruby.”</p>

<p>Well, I take it that you have no additions or corrections to make to what I have
just read you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. I want to thank you for spending all this time, and
I realize that this has been a sacrifice for you to come down here, and we will
try to make arrangements to make photo copies of a few of the records that you
have.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. You are welcome to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Again I say you are very kind to give us your time, and I would
ask you a couple of questions in conclusion.</p>

<p>One, have you been interviewed by any member of the Commission Staff prior
to appearing here today?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Those FBI men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. By other than that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Barry and Mr. Kelley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But nobody that identified himself as a member of the Commission’s
staff, as opposed to an FBI agent or Secret Service agent? You
haven’t been other than these two interview reports that I have showed you?
Have you been interviewed by anybody on any occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t think so, unless when the police and the FBI or anyone
comes to my house about any of the rents or anyone, I always talk to them, and
now I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, before <span class="locked">I——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I give them all the information I can give them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Before I sat down here with you in the room this afternoon, did
I interview you at all?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I did meet you out in the hallway?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. Yes, sir; I met you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But I didn’t ask you any questions?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. No; you didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now I will ask you this, too. Do you have any information
that you consider to be of any importance in connection with what this Commission
is doing, that you haven’t provided us so far?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I don’t think I have any information at all that I could give you.
If I had, I had already called someone and told you about it. If I had ever
talked to anyone or anyone mentioned anything about this, I just, like my
sister, if she got a letter through the mail, I said, “You call the FBI immediately
and turn it in.” “Turn everything in.”</p>

<p>She would get letters through the mail from different people and the people
would be coming out interviewing, and I said, “Call immediately and tell them.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If anything comes to your attention</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I will call you and tell you, surely. I will try to be as helpful
as I can be, because I don’t understand it, like everyone else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We certainly appreciate that, and we are trying to get as much
as we can.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. I can’t feature Ruby killing Oswald, and I can’t feature the President
being killed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, you are not the only one.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. It shocked me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Again, I want to thank you for coming down here. It has been
a pleasure to meet you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cheek</span>. It is a pleasure meeting you.</p>

you do have so suppose you present those that you brought with you in response
to the subpena.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. All I had was the subpena from the Jack Ruby murder trial.
Some news clippings from the Ruby trial, and then more or less a diary I have
been keeping for a little while of my own movements.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Mr. Crafard, concerning the diary about your movements,
do you have any objection if we have photostatic copies made of the pages on
which you have made entries?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you wish to retain the original of this yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Unless it is of some use to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, it may be, but on the other hand, I don’t want to take
it away from you unless you feel that you don’t want to keep it or have no use
for it yourself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir. The usual tour is 3 to 4 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well now, what caused you to get out sooner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As far as I understand it is the next thing to a medical discharge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was it based upon, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. General, under honorable conditions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have a discharge reading general, under honorable conditions

<p>Do you have any objection, Mr. Crafard if we have a photostatic copy of this
document that you have just shown me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No objection.</p>

the original.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know the grounds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not sure of the grounds, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she divorce him or did he divorce her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe she divorced him. I am not positive about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir; I knew him very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know where he is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He lives at Port Huron, Mich., just out of Port Huron, Mich.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Farmer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Has he remarried?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He plans to remarry this summer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you seen him recently?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Last time I saw him was about 2 months ago. A little over
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About how long did you stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I stayed there for about, let’s see, I stayed there until the following
spring, in April.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That would have been April of 1960?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. April of 1960. Then I went back out home to Oregon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you left the U.S. Army, did you have any money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. How is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you left the U.S. Army did you have any money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just what I got from my discharge pay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I had right around $400 all together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that all you had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is all I had; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean is that all the property you had of any sort whatsoever?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I had a few items of personal clothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have an automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; not at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t own any real estate, I take it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t have any cash but what you said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would it be correct to estimate that your total worth other
than the cash you just mentioned at that time was less than a hundred dollars?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I would say so; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, how long did you stay with your sister?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I stayed with them for about 6 or 7 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. In the pulpwoods.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What does that mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We were cutting pulpwood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did that pay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was piece work. We was making about $8 a cord.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About how much would that amount to a month?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Oh, man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just an estimate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Probably right around $400.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That would be net before taxes, wouldn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you assist your sister financially for board and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir; we was working together, my brother-in-law and I.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I mean was were you able to save any money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I didn’t save any money there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not. You stayed there about 7 months?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About 7 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you go then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Then I went back out home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. To Dallas, Oreg.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At the time you made the move then from the home of your
sister to Dallas, Oreg., how much money did you have then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About $150, enough to go out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it fair to state that you had spent all the money you had
earned by working plus a good part of the savings or the money you had received
from the Army?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that upon arrival at your parent’s home in Dallas, Oreg.,
you had approximately $150.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was almost broke when I arrived home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any other type of property?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you fix the time of your arrival back in Dallas, Oreg.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It would have been in March of 1960.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. How long did you stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. My main residence then up until this last fall has been Dallas,
Oreg. I have done a lot of traveling around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do to support yourself from the time you returned
to your parents in March 1960?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I went to work in the <span class="locked">fruit——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In the fruit what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. In the fruit, picking fruit. Then I went to work in a cannery.
Then I was gone for a while and I worked with the carnivals when I was gone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think we had better get some details about that. How long
did you work with the fruit industry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Probably right around a month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That would have been in the spring of 1960?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then you went to the cannery?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you work there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I worked there for about 6 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you make there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was making a $1.15 an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did it net you before taxes by the month about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I would say probably right around $400 for the month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you leave your parent’s home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I couldn’t give you an exact date on this, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, would it be fair to say it was about 7 months after you
arrived there from Michigan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was in the spring of 1961. I believe, probably in April of
1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that in fact you were with your parents after you moved
from Michigan to Dallas, Oreg., for approximately 1 year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of which time you say you worked about 7 months?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I went to school for about 6 months out of it, about 5 or 6
months out of the year, I attended high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you finish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What high school was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Dallas High.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oregon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were not earning anything then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I take it that you left Dallas, Oreg., about April in 1961, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you go next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I went to California where I joined the carnival.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What part of California?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Let’s see, in Oroville, Calif., where I joined the carnival.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oroville?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What carnival was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Royal West Golden Gate combined.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Royal West Golden Gate combined?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What type of carnival was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was more or less about the general run of the mill for a
carnival. Mostly rides.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say “carnival” you are talking about a place where
they have these rides for children and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How big a carnival was it, I mean, how many people were
involved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It is pretty hard to say exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do with it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was working with the circus that was attached to the carnival.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Animal circus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They all traveled as a group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long were you with that, in that sort of a group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I worked that for about 3 or 4 weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is all, 3 or 4 weeks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, where did you go to next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I traveled through Georgia where I joined another carnival in
Georgia, Jerry Lepke Ten in One.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What sort of a side show was it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He had the sword box, ladder of swords, fire eater, two-headed
baby show, and a snake girl show.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do at that carnival?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Roustabout and barker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long were you with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was with Lepke for about a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. After that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Then I went to Michigan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I visited with my sister and my brother-in-law again for a
little while for about 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Tenniswood. Then I went to Detroit where I joined a kiddyland
setup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is sort of a carnival strictly for children?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; parking lot carnival.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what time was that then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that was in the fall of 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you stay with that organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was with him for about 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I went back to Dallas, Oreg.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you got to Dallas what did you do? Oregon, I mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I went to work part time at the Muir and McDonald Leather
Tannery and then I went to work for Boise Cascade Valzets Division for the
Boise Cascade Plywood. I worked for them until in June of 1962, June 10th,
1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long then did you work for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. For about 6 months, I believe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What were you making there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was making, I believe, $2.25 an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what did it amount to by the month before taxes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About $400, $450.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were not married at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you able to save money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was spending my money just about as fast as I made it. I
was traveling, paying for transportation back and forth to work, buying clothes.
By that time I had bought a motorcycle or a motorbike, and I bought a few
items, I bought a refrigerator for my mother or a dryer for my mother at that
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, we have some information that you worked for Federal
Aviation Agency through July and October of 1960 in Los Angeles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; in Los Angeles—I believe they were out of Los Angeles,
where I worked for them that was over in Nevada.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What kind of work did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Surveyor’s assistant. I had forgotten I had worked for them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us anything about your employment with Stewart-Hill
in Berkeley, Calif., 1052 Dwight Way, Berkeley, Calif?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember even.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That would have been between July and September of 1960?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember working for the Teer Plating Co., Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us about it, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I worked for them 2 or 3 weeks, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much did you make with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was making a dollar and a quarter an hour while I worked
for them. I believe when I left there my last check was either $65 or $85.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that the first time you had ever been in Dallas, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Let’s see, I believe it was, I am not certain of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was between April and June of 1961, was it not?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so. The way I have traveled around, I had a lot of
jobs I even forgot about almost.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was this Muir Co. you were talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was a leather tannery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In Dallas, Oreg.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Muir McDonald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At 111 Street. Is that Dallas, Tex., or Dallas, Oreg.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Dallas, Oreg.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You worked for them for about almost year, with a couple of
time outs, didn’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Altogether I worked for them about 18 months. But including
the time I worked part time and I worked part time for them for a while
while I was working for J. C. Tracy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was J. C. Tracy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is a cannery in Dallas, Oreg.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that during one period you were working two jobs—with
Muir McDonald and with J. C. Tracy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir; I worked for Muir and McDonald an hour and a half,
2 hours, maybe 3 hours a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever work for Ablon Poultry Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir; that was after I was married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. In Dallas, Tex. At that time I was residing at the Letot Trailer
Park with my wife and family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you leave Dallas, Oreg., then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. When I went to work there, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had gone to Dallas, Oreg., I think it was in the spring of
1961, wasn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you stayed there really about 18 months, right, working
for Muir McDonald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. All together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you left Dallas, Oreg., you were not married, were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The last time I left <span class="locked">Dallas——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; I am talking about the time you left in the latter part of
1962 or early 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was married June of 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So your wife lived with you for some time in Dallas, Oreg.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. For about 6 months we was living in Dallas, Oreg., from June 10
until I believe in December.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where were you married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was married in Dallas, Oreg.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was your wife from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was her name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Her maiden name was Wilma Jean Case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. C-a-s-e?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had she been married before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was her husband’s name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Donald Johnson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many times was she married before she married you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just the one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you meet her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I met her in Amarillo, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When? How long before you married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was in 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What part of 1961?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. In the spring, I believe, it would have been in March of 1961.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You knew her about 15 months then before you got married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. All told; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you working in Dallas at the time you met her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I wasn’t employed at the time I met my wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you meet her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I met her at the Salvation Army in Amarillo, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was she doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She was there with her husband Donald Johnson at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She was living with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was she divorced from her husband?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She was divorced in 1962, I believe, in April, I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All the time you were living up in Oregon with your parents,
did you see her or correspond with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I hadn’t saw her for a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had not seen her for a year when you married her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I had—I went to Dallas, Tex., trying to find her. From
Dallas, Tex., I went to Las Vegas, Nev., where I got in touch with her and where
we corresponded for a period of about 5 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I gather from what you say that your interest in her as a person
to be your wife grew up during this period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Mostly, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And she agreed to marry you and came up to Dallas, Oreg., to
do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she work while you were living in Dallas, Oreg.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; she lived with my parents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And so did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have any children?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I have one child by her. She has a stepson, I have a stepson,
her son.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She had a son by the first marriage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is that son’s name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Don Johnson, Billy Don Johnson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He is 2 years old approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He is 2 years old now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was 2 years old in December. He will be 2½.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you have a child by her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir; Robert Johnson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was that child born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was born March 10, 1963—March 2, excuse me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you move to Dallas, Tex.—let’s take it chronologically.
What happened after you left, where did you go after you left Dallas, Oreg.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I went to California, I left Dallas, Oreg., the first day of March
1963. I went to California where I spent the month, spent about 3 or 4 weeks,
then I went to Dallas, Tex., where my wife was living. We had a reconciliation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Before you tell us about the reconciliation, you had better tell
us about the breakup because I don’t think that is in the record yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We—she had left me about 6 months after we married, and I
stayed in Dallas, Oreg.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So she left you about December 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I stayed in Dallas, Oreg., for about 6 months after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She was pregnant then, was she not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. To my knowledge, as far as I know; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The child was born in March of 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, I will tell you the truth, the doctor has some doubts himself
so I couldn’t say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean she was pregnant when she left is what I mean in December.
I think we are thinking about two different things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. I believe we are thinking about the same thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am not asking you whether she was pregnant when you married
her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am asking you whether she was pregnant when she left you
in December of 1962, because you have just told us that the child was born in
March of 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I will put it this way. When the doctor was informed she had
a child, her doctor was then informed she had a child, he was very shocked
and surprised that she had had a child, and she was his patient in May of 1962.
He operated on her in May of 1962. So in other words, there is some doubt
as to the fact that the child was mine and actually there is a little doubt as to
the child is actually hers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I wish you would explain that latter part. How can
there be some doubt that the child is hers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t really understand it entirely myself. But the doctor
that performed the operation when he was informed she had had the child he was
very shocked and very surprised that she had had a child. He wouldn’t say
any reason for being so but he was. But I took him—I had understood from
him that she wouldn’t be able to have a child for about 2 years after the
operation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the cause of your breakup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That, I do not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean she just left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she leave any notes or anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She didn’t leave anything. I went to work on Tuesday morning
and come home Tuesday and she was gone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With her child?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. With the boy; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you attempt to find her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I put a tracer on her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well now, when you say you put a tracer, what do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I had the law put a tracer out on her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As a missing person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As a missing person; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you get any reports?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you next see her or hear from her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I heard from her in February of 1963. The latter part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In what way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She wrote to me and told me that she was going to have the
baby, and then in March of 1963 I received a letter in California, my folks had
sent down to me, from her saying that she had had the baby and would love for
me to come see the baby if I wanted to. And I went to Dallas, Tex. And we had
a reconciliation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What date did you arrive in Dallas, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Let’s see, right around the 14th, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of March?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Of March.</p>

<p>Mr Hubert. Did you have any money then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have any other kind of property?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; just a few clothes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it fair to say you were, pretty broke?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was she living?</p>

<p>Mr Crafard. She was at that time staying with her mother and father in
Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At what location?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. At Letot Trailer Park.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you spell that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. L-e-t-o-t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where is that located?</p>

<p>Mr Crafard. On Lombardy Lane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you live with her then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do, get another trailer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. For about a week I lived there with her and her parents. I
went to work at the Ablon Poultry and her parents moved away and then for a
while her brother and her sister-in-law lived with us; we lived together for a
while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so; I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you go?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I take it that these jobs simply gave you enough money to live on
and save up a little so you could move to the next place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. After that where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am just trying to think of the name. I can think of the first
name but I can’t think of his last name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Suppose you give us that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. His first name was Bob. There were two brothers owned it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you stay with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir; that was in Memphis, Tenn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you joined him really to move, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. I made the move with a friend of mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understood that you were working with the circus or carnival
operated by a man named Bob and his brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you quit them to join Leonard Wood’s outfit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; it was better pay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you stay with Wood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was with them for, I think it was the last 4 days of the fair,
about 4 days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then you quit him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Actually I got fired from him. There was a girl there that
kept hanging around the ride and we couldn’t get rid of her and everybody
tried to get rid of her. She thought she was in love with me or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So Leonard Wood fired you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You could tell that from the conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, they just walked up to each other and shook hands and
called each other by the first name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the substance of the conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Mostly the conversation had to do with a twistboard exerciser
that Ruby was trying to promote.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. And he was there for about a half, 45 minutes that evening,
and it was 2 or 3 days later before I saw him again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Before you go on, would you tell us how long after you joined
the fair did you first see this man Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About 2 or 3 days, about 2 days after I joined the fair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what was the purpose of the conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe Mr. Miles—he had brought some props, a couple of
prop chairs, some chairs used for props and a mirror used for a prop to be used.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Jack Ruby brought that out to them?</p>

that Ruby had some financial interest in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he indicate what it was about, how much?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, did Ruby put up money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. From what I understood he had put up some money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I have no idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear Mr. Craven or Mr. Miles talk about what percentage
he might have in the interests of the project?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; whenever I was around Mr. Craven and Mr. Miles I
was pretty busy working most of the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you lived in the tent all the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any friends in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There was a few people that I know there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you name them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, at that time there was as far as I knew my brother-in-law,
John Case, lived in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He still did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. And there was a few members of the church my wife and I
went to still in Dallas there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Brother Lee Cooksey and Robert Roskydall I believe it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who else?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. And that was about the only ones I knew around there right
then. I met some people during that fair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As to these people you have named, how close a relationship
did you develop?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just church members together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What church was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. General Assembly and Church of the First Born.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where is it located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Out North Dallas is all I can give you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was this State fair project called, “How Hollywood Makes
Movies,” a success financially?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; it was an absolute failure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean people didn’t flock to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We went bankrupt, they went broke.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean they closed before the fair closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir; it was only open for about a week. I had heard rumors
to the effect that Mr. Craven had wrote a lot of bad checks to start with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you paid any salary by them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Mostly about all I got from them was expenses. It was supposed
to be $5 a day but about all I got was my meals and cigarettes furnished.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You got money from them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, did it actually close its doors and stop operating before
the fair closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; about a week, it only ran about a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the fair lasted how long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. 2 weeks. When they left it was another outfit come in there with
a dance band.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say, “come in there,” you mean took over the space?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Took over the space in the same tent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you stay with that outfit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I stayed with that outfit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the name of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe they even had a real name for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us some of the people who were connected with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Let’s see. I can’t even—there was Big Jess, he was one of the
big shots around the State fair there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he a musician?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; he owns two or three rides on the fair grounds, permanent
rides on the Dallas Texas State Fair Grounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How was he connected with the organization that took the place
of the other one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He took up the lease, the rent on the tent, on the space, and had
this other outfit come in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The other outfit I take it was a band?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; musical band.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many pieces were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Let’s see, I believe it was three- and four-piece band.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How was it supposed to make money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Charged 50 cents to get in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean to listen to the music?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Mostly listen to the music.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. They had some couples on stage dancing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They had some what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. They had some couples on stage dancing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean couples from the audience?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. At first and then they wouldn’t allow them to have couples on
the stage from the audience any more so they hired a couple of dancers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did they hire them from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Girls around the fairgrounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they get any from Ruby’s place?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. One of the girls came out from Ruby’s place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was her name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Joy Dale.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Dale?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Dale. I don’t know her real name. Her first name was Joyce
from what I understood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you recognize the name Joyce McDonald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that was her last name, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But her stage name was Joy, not Joyce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Joy Dale.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What kind of a dance did she do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About all she done was worked out front. She would get out
front and more than anything just stand around out there. She would come out
originally to help this “How Hollywood Makes Movies” setup. They used her
as an attraction piece.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Ruby bring her out there then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe the first time she came out there I believe Jack brought
her out there and introduced her to Miles and Craven.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack have any interest in the second organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. To my knowledge, no. Except that he knew the man who was
managing the setup there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you have given us his name, I think already.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Dusty was the name of the guy who was managing it. He was
another carnival, carnie. He was managing it, Jess was backing it but Dusty
was managing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know Dusty’s last name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I can’t recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did he live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know—let’s see, I think his home was somewhere in Ohio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he stay with the organization until the end of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He stayed with the organization until the law closed them down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The stage dancers got, the last day they was getting, pretty wild.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean the last day of the fair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; the last day they was open. It was 2 or 3 days before the
fair closed, they were getting pretty wild.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. With their dancing; it was getting real sexy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It wasn’t a striptease, was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; more than anything they were using the “Dirty Dog,” and
it can be made so filthy that it will almost turn a person’s stomach if they do
it right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do they actually use dogs in this dance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; it is a dance called, “The Dog,” but they have got what they
call, “The Dirty Dog,” too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many girls were involved in that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There were two girls and one guy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. One of those girls was the girl called Joy Dale?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was she doing at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As far as I know Joy was just working at the club, Carousel
Club at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She wasn’t connected with the show at the fair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She hadn’t been out there but about one time after the dance
outfit took over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know the names of the girls on the stage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember their names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had they come from Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. They met them on the fairgrounds. They put an ad and the
girls contacted them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Ruby come around to that second thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was around a couple of times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. A couple of times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he stay very long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I could notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was he with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Mostly by himself when he came out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you get to know him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, just a couple of times talking to him around the fairgrounds
there and he gave me a free pass into his club any time I wanted to
go in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not until after the fair closed when I went to work for Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much money did you make at the fair altogether?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Altogether at the fair all I made was expenses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As I understood you had very little when you got there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that when the fair closed you were just about flat broke.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was flat broke.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened after the fair closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Ruby hired me then to tear some lumber down, a stage he had
had there at the tent. He brought the lumber out of it and he had me tear that
down and clean it up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, the thing had been closed for 2 days before the fair
closed itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I don’t suppose it reopened in any other fashion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did it take you to do the job that Ruby hired you for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About 4 hours all told.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And this stuff was moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Moved to the Carousel Club, downstairs in the Carousel Club
where it was stored.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have anything to do with the moving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; helped move the lumber and clean it up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then your original employment by Ruby was for that job alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. When he hired me he said he had that for me that I could do
and then he said I could stay, he wanted me to stay at the club that night, and the
next day he talked to me and he had me stay with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us about your arrangement with Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Mostly, there was no set salary, any time I needed salary I
put a draw slip in the till and take it out of the till.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What were you supposed to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Help clean the club up, work the lights on the girls on stage,
answer the phone calls, answer the phone when he wasn’t there. Work on the
bar if they needed me or anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you did almost anything you were asked to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you live at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I stayed at the Carousel Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What accommodations did they have for sleeping and so on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We had a room with a cot in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whose room was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It had been at one time a dressing room for one of the stars he
had in there, Jada, a stripper by the name of Jada.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was she there when you first went there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. When I first went there; yes. At that time I slept in Jack’s
office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then when you first went to the Carousel you slept in Jack’s
office?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there a cot there, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He had a couch in his office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you first went there it was the day the fair closed or the
day after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The day after the fair closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the date of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t remember the date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you stay—strike that.</p>

<p>How long did you sleep in Jack’s office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. For about a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then you moved into Jada’s room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or dressing room, that is after she had gone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, after she had gone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you stayed there until you left finally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I left the 23d of November, I believe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What were your hours there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Any hours. I would just get up, I usually got up about 8
o’clock in the morning and I would be lucky if I would get to bed before
3:30, 4 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How come you would get up so early?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Get the club cleaned up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Wasn’t there a man to help?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I took care of that mostly myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Howard who used to
do that stuff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Howard was a maintenance man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just maintenance, upkeep of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He didn’t do the actual janitorial work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Cleaning up the cigarettes and that sort of thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He had a young fellow by the name of Andrew who was his
assistant manager.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that Andrew Armstrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. When I first went there, Andrew was doing the cleaning
up and then I started helping him, and then I had been there for about 2
weeks and I was doing all the cleaning up by myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The club usually closed you say about 2 or 3 in the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; the club usually closed, I believe it was 1:30 or 2 o’clock
in the morning the club closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You would get to bed about 2:30 or 3 o’clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Before everybody got out of there it would be 2:30, 3 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then you went to bed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Then I went to bed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did the cleaning up job usually take?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. If I started cleaning up at 9 o’clock I would be finished by 11:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you had 2½ hours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you then usually free?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. Jack would come in about 11:30 and be there 2 or 3
hours. After he left I had to stay there and answer the phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The club wasn’t open then, was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, the club didn’t open until 7:30 at night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So your duties were to clean up as soon as you got up and that
took 2½ or 3 hours and then just to stay there answering phone calls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you go to eat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Most of the time I eat at the Walgreen drugstore catercornered
across the street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you say you just took some money out of the cash register
for that purpose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack permit you to do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, he told me; otherwise, I wouldn’t have done so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have any limitation on how much to take?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much did it amount to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It usually amounted to $4, $5, maybe $6 a day, what with my
cigarettes and what I ate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any time off for yourself at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. A couple of nights after the club closed we went out to, he
took us out to, the Vegas Club. We were out there until about 3 o’clock in
the morning. And I had a couple of times I could, Andy was around the club
and I could take off in the afternoon if Andy was around the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the purpose of keeping you around the club after your
cleanup job was over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. So far as I understand just mostly answer the phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there many phone calls to be answered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There was quite a few that would come in—generally, usually,
people calling in, would start calling in about 1 o’clock for reservations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack give you any instructions as to how you could handle
the phone calls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He told me to answer the phone and ask them what they
wanted, and if they had a message for Jack so they could give me a number
for him to call back. If they had a reservation, how to take a reservation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have to make notations about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, I had a notebook there at the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that when he called in you would just tell him who had called?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he sometimes give you instructions as to things you
were to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not unless it was—a couple of times he told me to feed the
dogs or something like that—when he would call in, he would ask me if I
fed the dogs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where were they kept?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. They were kept in a room behind the kitchen area, a storeroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. When I first went there he had two dogs at the club and then
his Sheba that he kept with him all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say when you first went he had that many dogs, did that
change during the time you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About a week before the assassination, a man that he had given
the dog to brought the dog back and Jack gave me instructions to check the
freight prices to California, a friend of his out there had wanted the dog, and
he was going to send it out there. So he gave me instructions to check the
freight, how to ship it, and about the crate and food and everything for the dog—to
ship it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. For a period then there were three dogs there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that dog ever shipped to California?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not while I was there; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what the man’s name was who the dog was to be
shipped to in California?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what place in California?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Los Angeles, I believe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had to check that to get the rates?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you ever seen that man to whom it was to be shipped?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not as far as I—I am not positive I had seen him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have some idea you might have seen him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There was a couple of friends of Jack’s there from California
while I was there and it might have been one of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know their names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t remember their names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember when they were at Jack’s place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As I say, I believe it was about the second or third week I was
there with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there—you say there were a couple of fellows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Two or three or how many?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think they come at different times, I believe there was one
guy come in one time and then about a week—3 or 4 days later another guy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But they were both there together for a while?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Do you remember anything about the first man who
came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I couldn’t even identify him if he was to stand in front
of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he spend a lot of time around the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He wasn’t there too much during the day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would he come as a patron or was he working when he was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he came in as a guest of Jack’s, a house guest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you introduced to him, ever introduced to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Jack introduced me to him the day he came in. I don’t remember
his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever learn anything about what he did for a living?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The second man who came, were you introduced to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. More likely I was, but I don’t recall him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall at all what he looked like, the second man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall at all what the first man looked like?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, I don’t; I saw so many people around the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The second man who came, how long did he stay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Saw him around, I think, two different days, two days in a row
that he was in the club with Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he come at night or during the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. During the day that I saw him. He might have been there at
night but I didn’t notice him if he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you pick up that his business might have been there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. All I figured, all I knew, was that he had come to see Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never heard them conversing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. When Jack was talking to somebody I pretty much made it a
habit to step back where I couldn’t hear the conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why did you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I have done that every since I can recall. When I was younger
I worked for a fellow and he started talking to somebody and I would stay right
there and he got kind of angry a couple of times; so, since then, I have made it
a habit to step back where I can’t hear the conversation that is being held.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever hear from Andy Armstrong or anybody else anything
about either of these two men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What makes the visit of these two men a part of your memory
now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just that it was shortly before he had the dogs brought back
to him, and he asked me to make arrangements to ship them to California. I
believe they were from Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, the fact that you were making preparations to
ship the dogs to California, and that they were from California, is the fact that
causes you to associate the two, and to remember those two men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is all I can think of causing the association.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall, Larry, if at any time Jack had a photographer
at the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; he did for publicity purposes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall where that photographer was from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall any—how long was this photographer there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was around there for 3 or 4 days in the evening before the
show was going on. I believe he was from a magazine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was his name Eddie Rocco?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this one of the two men you have been talking about from
California or were these two men different, from California?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall; it might have been. He might have been from
California. But these two men were not photographers. They come in, it looked
to me, it appeared to me to be businessmen, <span class="locked">fellows——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they have long conversations with Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not in my presence. Not when they were around the club. They
was never in the club with him more than 5 or 10 minutes when they were there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What would happen, they would come in and talk to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. They would come in and he might have some phone calls to make
or something and they would stay there while he made the phone calls and
then they would leave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know where they went?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Jack would go out with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you notice how long they stayed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I wouldn’t know how long they would stay with Jack. He might
take off at 11 o’clock in the morning and wouldn’t be back all day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I mean is, do you have any recollection of seeing him leave
with one of those men or either of them and then come back with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall him doing so. He might have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you any recollection that having left with one of those
men he came back alone and particularly at what time or how much longer
did he come back alone, how much later did he come back alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I have no recollection of that either. He was—people would
come to the club to see him, he would go downstairs, leave with them, and sometimes
he would be gone the rest of the afternoon or sometimes he would come
back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What we would like you to tell us is, what there was about these
two men from California that makes their visits there still a part of your
memory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just the fact that shipping the dogs to California, I kind of
more or less associated the fact and that they were from Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever gather where they were staying while they were
in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who usually woke you up in the morning over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Jack would usually call me in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Anywhere from 8 o’clock on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any other way of waking up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not unless Andrew would come by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there an arrangement that one of them would wake you so
you might commence your work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Jack would usually call me in the morning as soon as he got up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Armstrong call you sometimes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. A couple of times Andy would call me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Ralph Paul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you come to know him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Jack introduced me to him at the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he there often?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was there about six or seven times that I can recall. I believe
he was a business associate of Jack’s.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you find that out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He had a drive-in setup, drive-in cafe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was out northeastern Texas, somewhere, Dallas,
northeastern part of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you say Jack told you he had an interest in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Jack said they were associated. He called him his partner
all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did the man come on particular days of the week or just at
random?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. Never knew when he was going to come.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see Jack give him any money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it correct to state then that all you know about whether Paul
was or was not an associate is what Jack told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You observed nothing of your own that would indicate that the
man had some property interest in that club or some financial interest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Other than the fact that when he did come Jack and him would
go into the office, almost every time he would come they would be in the office,
from a half hour to 2 or 3 hours at a time talking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you didn’t know about what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, I didn’t know about what.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack keep any books?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of books did he keep?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As far as I know it was just his receipts and regular tax, regular
books, business books.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean ledgers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who made the entries in them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was either Jack Ruby or Andrew. He had an accountant do
all his bookkeeping.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember who he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he was over the place one time while I was there during
the day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you don’t know his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He asked for the books?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Andy give him some papers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Papers or books?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Some of the receipts, bar receipts and door receipts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever see Jack and Ralph Paul go over any books
together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. I just says whenever they was together like that they
would be together in the office, the office door would be locked and they would
do talking. It was usually during when—during the evening when the club was
in operation and I would be out front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Eva Grant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She was Jack Ruby’s sister.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you come to meet her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I first met her at the fairgrounds, Jack first introduced me at
the fairgrounds and then later I met her at the club.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How often did you see her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I saw Eva about four times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you get to know her as a person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not too well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On those four occasions how long were you in her company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just for a few minutes at a time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she have any interest in Ruby’s affairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She managed the Vegas Club for Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she have an interest in the Carousel so far as you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. So far as I know; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Jack never told you that she did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; as far as I knew the Carousel Club was Jack’s as far as I
knew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you give us a physical description of her, how tall was she,
how heavy was she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She is an oldish woman, probably weighs maybe 130, 135 pounds,
stands probably right around 5′6″, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So she is not a heavy woman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not exceptionally heavy, no. For her age she is a real nice-looking
woman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know her age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. How is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know her age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, but I believe she is Jack’s older sister.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you get that information, from Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, from the way he talked. He had one older sister and a
younger sister, and I met the family, the rest of his family at the trial and the
other sister was younger than Jack, I knew that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have been to the Vegas, haven’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Oh, yes; I was in the Vegas Club on several occasions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You worked there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Two nights that I run the Vegas Club myself. One night I was
the only one there. The next night I had a waitress there with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You stated that she was the manager of the Vegas Club for
Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you get that information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Jack said she was managing the club for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you there when she was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was there a couple of evenings after the Carousel Club closed
we went over there to Vegas Club and she was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of George Senator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was a friend of Jack’s he was with Jack quite often.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, how often?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He would come into the club with Jack three or four times a week
anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean when they would come in at night or in the afternoon
this man Senator would be with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It would be maybe during the day or maybe in the evenings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you give us a description of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He is a kind of heavy-set fellow about 5′4″, 5′5″.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. A very short man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Fairly short. Wasn’t much taller than Jack. He probably
would, I would say, probably would weigh about 180, 185.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Fat or husky?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Kind of on the fat side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have a limp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he did, I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know anything else about the relationship between him
and Jack?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe him and Jack, he was rooming with Jack, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you ever at Jack’s apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was over to Jack’s apartment on two different occasions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see then any evidence that they were living together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The only thing I knew for certain when I was over there there
was a two-bedroom apartment living room, kitchen and two bedrooms and he
told me that one bedroom was George’s room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Ruby told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see George at the apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You only went there twice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I was there three times all told. I was there for a few
minutes and then leave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you never saw Senator at the club—at the apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know if Senator had any financial interest in Jack’s
affairs?</p>

<p>Mr Crafard. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he work for Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he was on the door a little bit, several times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What does working on the door mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He took the door price, he took the cover charge at the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How about a man named Bill DeMar, do you know him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Bill DeMar was a comedian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he there when you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He came in while I was there, Jack hired him to come in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did he stay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think he was there yet when the club was closed, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What sort of a fellow was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was kind of an easygoing guy. Like most of your real good
comedians, he was cracking a joke all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I gather from what you have told us about your life you
can size these people up pretty well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I haven’t only been wrong with my opinion once. I formed an
opinion of a person with the first six or seven words they say and I have never
been wrong in my life but once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What do you think of Bill DeMar as to his truthfulness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was a kind of a likable guy but to me he just didn’t strike me,
I didn’t like him. I got along with him, I associated with him at the club but
I wouldn’t want to associate with him as a close friend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was there about <span class="locked">him——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He didn’t strike me just right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think he is a fake?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, I think 90 percent of him was fake, I would say. He
was a fairly decent comedian but his way was “Big me and little you. I am
everything and nobody else is anything,” was the way he struck me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was there about how long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he was there for about 2 weeks, I am not sure, between
2 and 3 weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever get to converse with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. While he was there in the club I would speak with him, talk
with him a little bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There was never any trouble between you, was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, there was never any trouble between us. I say he was an
easy-going person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see Joyce McDonald around there, the girl you
previously identified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Joy was working on the stage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was she doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She was a stripper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the relationship between her and Jack, do you know?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That of boss and employee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never observed anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She was with him a lot, though, personally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She would talk with him around the club that I could see. She
would talk with Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Didn’t she go out to dinner with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. To my knowledge, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Some time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She might have. I heard Jack make the remark at one time that
he had been involved with every one of the girls that worked for him at one
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You heard him say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He made the remark to me because of one of the waitresses
worked for him was a real sweet-looking girl and she had a real wonderful
personality.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Marge, that is the only name I know her by, I don’t know her
last name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She was a stripper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She was a waitress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So what about Marge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. How is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about Marge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I said something, going out with her or something and he made
the statement that he had had a relationship with everyone of the girls who
worked for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say relationship or when he said it, you did understand
him to refer to sexual relationship?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Sexual relationship.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There can be no doubt about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you infer from that remark of his relative to the
remark you had made about your interest in Marge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, it would—my remark had been on the sexual basis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, did you regard that as sort of a consent on his part for
you to go ahead?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. He didn’t want me to go, to have anything to do with any
of the girls that worked for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that in effect he was telling you that he was the one who
was to have the sexual relationships with the girls and not anyone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is about the effect of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say it as clearly as that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; he didn’t say it in so many words, but just an implied
statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the meaning you got out of that colloquy, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you tell us as best you can remember what the conversation
was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know. I said something about I would like to get ahold
of that or something, and Jack said, he said, he had already gotten into it or
something like that, and something said about his girls, and I said so far as I
am concerned—at that time it was a little later after I went to work for him—I
said, “As far as I am concerned you haven’t got a stripper I am interested in,”
and he said, “I have had a relationship with every one of them.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you think Jack was puffing on that or did you believe him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know. As far as the strippers went I can very well
believe that but the waitresses it was pretty hard to believe because little
Marge, she ended up marrying a guy, and she was pretty stiff on him, and in
fact, so much that I have tried everything I could to get her even to go out
with me and she wouldn’t do it. And the other girls didn’t seem too much to
me like the type that would do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did have a girl you went out with you used to meet at the
Eatwell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. One of the girls who worked for Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was her name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She went to work for him later, I can’t even remember her
name now. The only one of the bunch I can remember, there were three girls
there roomed together, the only one I can remember is Norma, and I first got
acquainted with her was over the telephone and we had quite a conversation,
and we became rather friendly over the telephone and when we met we was
fairly friendly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she work for Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; Jack tried to get her to work as a stripper which he would
do with every female, every nice-looking girl, that he met. She would have
nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you had this conversation with her on the telephone? Did
you get to meet her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I met her at the club; yes. I met her in person and then I
got to know her fairly well. We was together several times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean on private dates?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, it would be her and these other two girls. I was with
the other girl mostly, and we would go over together and three of us sit together
while we eat, and I would walk the girls home, something like that. They
would come to the club and the club would close and I would walk this other
girl home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, there were two girls who worked for the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; only one worked for the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which one was that, it was not Norma?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. <span class="locked">Norma——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was her name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I can’t remember that girl’s name. I can’t remember the
girl’s name. She was a woman of about 29 years old, she had a real nice personality
and was a wonderful person to talk to, all it was, just nice person to
talk to and relax and just have an enjoyable time away from the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was the one who was the waitress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir; she was a cocktail waitress at the club. I knew her
and her one girl friend were from back east somewhere and I met Norma back
at the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had Norma ever worked for the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. Jack was trying to get her to work for the club, was trying
to get her to work as a stripper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is Norma the girl you dated or saw quite a bit of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I saw her on two or three occasions before this other girl went
to work for Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And Norma is not a native of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She is a native of the Dallas area. Her home is about 20 miles
north of Dallas, Carrollton, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever go out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I never went out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you know it was out there? How did you find out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She give me her address, address and phone number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have that in the book you maintained for Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That was the reason for getting the phone and address. She
called and inquired for a job, and I got her address and phone number which I
do with all girls who come for a job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How do you know Jack tried to get her to be a stripper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He had her at the club on several occasions talking her into
being a stripper. He got her a job with Ralph Paul and he give her clothes
and he gave her money and I went over with her to one store where to buy clothes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Jack bought her the clothes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He give me the money to buy the clothes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much was the amount?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. $10 bill, I believe, at that time. Two or three times he bought
clothes for the girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Ten dollar bill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. She couldn’t buy much with a $10 bill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She needed certain kinds of clothes, slacks and a blouse to work
in when she went to work for Ralph Paul.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know what work she had been doing before she came to
work for Paul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; all I know she had been on several occasions in the club with
Jack. They were pretty thick for a while, and then something happened between
them to where she wouldn’t have anything to do with Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you don’t know what it was that happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I have no definite knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have some idea?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I have an opinion; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you give us an idea?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was making a big play for her, and my opinion is he got out
of hand and she put a stop to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there anything else said by someone else that led you to
believe it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Mostly she referred to it. She inferred it happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What would be getting out of hand in that situation, would it be
simply Jack wanting to go to bed with her or would it be some unusual kind of
sexual relations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I would say wanting to go to bed with her as far as my
knowledge. From what I knew of Norma she was a pretty decent girl. She
was a little wild but she was a fairly decent girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How old a girl would you say she was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe Norma was 18. She was a very friendly person, easy
to like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have a girl who worked at the Eatwell Restaurant that
you dated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you did go to the Eatwell Restaurant on Main Street, I think
it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was on Commerce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Commerce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I went there most of the time for my meals. It was, meals
were cheap, nice place to go to, it was close, and I sat around there and joked
with the girls and the one guy who worked in there I got acquainted with him
a little bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many girls in the club went there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe the girls in the club went there to eat often.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Huey Reeves?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The name isn’t familiar to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would it help you if I suggested that he worked at the Nichol’s
Garage next door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That would be the colored boy, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; this was a white man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. On a couple of occasions I sat in there and talked to him a couple
of nights. We would sit in there and talk, maybe have a beer or two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Beer or two where? At the Eatwell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; the garage. In the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. While you were there, who do you think were Ruby’s best
friends other than his business acquaintances?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Oh, man, the man I seen him with mostly was Senator, that
I know of him being was Senator, and Ralph Paul.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about girl friends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He had one girl, I believe her name was Linda or something,
she was a blond, she was a real nice looking girl that he went with quite a few
times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was she a stripper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; she didn’t work for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know her first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not positive of her name. I don’t recall her name.
Names is something to me that doesn’t mean much. I meet so many people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember the two fellows who ran the Eatwell
Restaurant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not too well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there a couple of older men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. One older man that worked behind the counter in the evenings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack also eat at the Eatwell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He didn’t eat there when I was there with him, after I went to
work for him. I understood the guy knew Jack real well, in fact he got in
the habit of calling me Jack Ruby, Jr., or Little Ruby, in a kind of teasing manner.
He was a very friendly person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that the older man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was an older man; I believe the oldest man that I saw there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You don’t recall his name, first name, do you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t recall his first name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was one of the fellows in there called Jimmy, that you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I recall. There is one of those messes of pictures
I would like to get hold of. There is one side of them I would just as soon get
ahold of and tear up.</p>

<p>(Brief recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You previously mentioned that there was a girl that Jack went
out with socially.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did I understand you correctly that you said she did not work
at the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How often did he go out with her, to your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know how often. It was quite often.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How would it come to your attention that he was going out
with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, usually he would bring her in to the club with him before
they would go, and after his club closed he would take her out to dinner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go out to dinner with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. On one occasion, I was at the Vegas, we went over to the
Vegas Club, and then the three of us went afterwards and had dinner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know other than that one occasion when he went out
with her that he took her to dinner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He would say that they was going to be taking her out to dinner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see her at his apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ever indicate in any way that she did go to his apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am going to show you what I am marking five photographs on
which I am writing as follows: “Washington, D.C., April 8, 1964, Exhibit
5200-A, Deposition of C. L. Crafard.” And I am signing my name below there.
On the next picture I am also marking, “Washington, D.C., April 8, 1964, Exhibit
5200-B, Deposition of C. L. Crafard,” and I am placing my name below
that. The third picture I am marking “Washington, D.C., April 8, 1964, Exhibit
5200-C, Deposition of C. L. Crafard,” and signing my name below that.
On the fourth picture I am marking “Washington, D.C., April 8, 1964, Exhibit
5200-D, Deposition of C. L. Crafard,” and marking my name down on that; and
on the fifth picture I am marking “Washington, D.C., April 8, 1964, Exhibit 5200-E,
Deposition of C. L. Crafard” and signing my name.</p>

<p>(The pictures referred to were marked Exhibits Nos. 5200-A through E for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I ask you to look at the pictures which have been marked
for identification as follows: Exhibits 5200-A, 5200-B, 5200-C, 5200-D, and
5200-E, and I ask you if in any one or all of those pictures you can see the girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
we have just been talking about, to wit, the girl that Jack took out to dinner
and otherwise met socially?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Her picture is in every one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Her picture is in every one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you identify the one that you are talking about by referring
to her dress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. In Exhibit A it would be the middle girl wearing a red and white
striped dress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember if it was red and white?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t remember the color, but it seems to me it would be
a stripe, something that people would wear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, do you remember ever seeing that girl in a red and white
dress similar to that dress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe she was in the club one time with a red and white
checkered dress on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Not stripes like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. It was a <span class="locked">softer——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So your remark that it was red and white was inadvertent, or
do you really have any recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It would be an inadvertent remark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Go on to the next picture and call off the identification
mark when you speak of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Exhibit B, it would be the girl in the middle in the striped
dress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. In Exhibit C it would be the girl behind Ruby looking over his
shoulder in the striped dress. Exhibit D it would be the girl behind Ruby looking
over his shoulder with the striped dress. Exhibit E would be the girl in
the middle with the striped dress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recognize Ruby in all of these pictures, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is the other girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The other girl was one of the strippers in his club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was her name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it is Tammi True.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That girl you have identified in all those pictures as having
the striped dress, that is the girl you are talking about whom Ruby used to take
out socially?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you don’t know her name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Could I say that other girl is Kathy Kay, I am definite of that
after looking at her picture closer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The blond girl is Kathy Kay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you want to change your opinion expressed a moment ago
that it was Tammi True, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Prior to the taking of this segment of the deposition dealing
with the identification of these photos, I think you had looked at at least one
of these photos and could not recognize the girl that you have now recognized
as being the companion of Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As being such. Then later you have come to the conclusion
that it is the girl. Can you tell us why you have now come to the conclusion
that it is the same girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. After looking at the whole group of pictures and the different
angles of her head where you can see her features better, I came to the conclusion
that is the girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, when you first expressed doubt as to whether
it was, you were looking at one picture only?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And after having looked at all of those pictures, that is to say
five of them as identified, you now are positive that that is the girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand you to say you had at least one occasion on which
you actually had dinner with Jack and this girl is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would it be fair to say you were in her company therefore and
could see her at close range for a period of at least an hour on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you don’t know who she is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I cannot recall her name, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I wish you would give some thought to what her name is before
you leave so perhaps we <span class="locked">can——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever have occasion to write her name down any place
for Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe her name was wrote down, I believe her name was
wrote down in the notebook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In the little notebook you were keeping for him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, what other friends did you note that Ruby
had? You mentioned George Senator, and you have mentioned this girl who
was in the striped dress in the Exhibits 5200-A, -B, -C, -D, and -E. Who else
do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Ralph Paul.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you have told us something about him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There was a couple of the comedians from some of the other
clubs that came up to the club quite often.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I wouldn’t know their names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there any others than those you have already mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I can name; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long were you at the club from the time you first went
there until the time you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Approximately 6 weeks to a month or 2 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see any members of the Dallas police force there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us something about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, the uniformed patrolman would come up every once in
awhile in the evening and have coffee on the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say on the club, you mean without paying for it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I on several occasions—I on several occasions served the coffee
for them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Normally you would collect for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean normally you would collect from another patron.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you didn’t collect from the police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Jack told me to go ahead and they could have coffee whenever
they wanted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you did not ask any money for the coffee because
you had been instructed not to by Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The girls had told me that they was allowed to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember which girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The waitresses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The waitresses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Jack never did mention the subject to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The only thing he ever mentioned was that the policemen went
off duty, would come in there when they were off duty, got their drinks at a
cut price.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the cut price?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The normal price was 60 cents, and they got them for 40
cents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That you say is when they were off duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he give you any instructions as to what the price was
to be when they came in on duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There was no charge for the coffee, and none would drink anything
other than coffee, to my knowledge, when they were on duty or maybe
a Coke or—a glass of Coke or a glass of 7-Up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did they identify themselves when they were off duty
so that they got the cut rate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, most of them when they come in there, when they come
to the door they got in the door free so they showed a card at the door, their
identification at the door. And then it usually would be at the bar, the girls
knew most of them that did come in there when they were off duty. Evidently
I took it that Jack had introduced them as officers, and we had occasion one
night to serve one of the gentlemen, we was talking, and one of the girls when
I took over the bar from Andy, he had to leave early, and he told me this
gentleman was a police officer. He said he only charged him 40 cents. So
I had occasion to talk with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you get to know any by sight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; not that I could—just when he walked in the door and say
he was a police officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know any by name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see any of those policemen at the Ruby trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall it, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many different policemen would you say came in to Ruby’s
place during the period you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. When they were off duty, to my knowledge, there was only about
4 or 5 of them would come in there, off duty, and it was usually the same ones
that were on duty that would come in to have coffee, patrolmen. The others
were usually plainclothesmen, detectives.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know what bureau any of them were attached to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know whether there were any of them attached to the
juvenile bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; not definitely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You have some thought that they were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. You mentioned the juvenile bureau, it seems to me there was
something mentioned about one of them being from the juvenile bureau or
something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is this something you read in the paper, or something that was
mentioned at the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, something that was mentioned at the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Ruby follow a pretty close routine of life insofar as his
activities were concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. For him, yes. His routine was for myself, or for any ordinary
businessmen that I have known, any businessmen that I have known, would
have been a real rough, hurry-scurry routine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, let’s take it timewise. For instance, you say he usually
called you in the morning. Was that pretty routine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; that varied.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I think you said that he came in usually sometime before
noon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that pretty regular?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Most of the time he would be in before noon, between 10:30 and
12 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then what would he do with the rest of the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, he would be around the club for maybe anywhere from
a half hour to 2 hours, then he would leave the club and I might not see him
again until midnight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then he stayed until the club closed?</p>

<p>Air. Crafard. When he came back to the club after the club opened he generally
stayed until the club closed. On three or four occasions he stayed until the
club closed and then he went over to the Vegas Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Normally what would he do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He would go over to the Vegas Club and pick up the receipts
for the day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As far as I know, go home maybe stop for a bite to eat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What would he do with the receipts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He would carry them home with him and the next day bring
them back to the Carousel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have a safe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; he bought a safe while I was with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was about 2 weeks prior to the assassination of President
Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did he happen to come to buy that safe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, he was always carrying quite a bit of cash and he was
always worried about having somebody rob him or something, and I guess he
wanted, he finally made up his mind to buy a safe and he went down to buy a
safe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir; I was with him when he purchased the safe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall where he went?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall the name of the company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Whereabouts was it located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Let’s see, it was a block and a half right straight behind the
Carousel Club, but I can’t recall the name of the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It would have been on Field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, Commerce—Field is next to Commerce, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was the next block back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it <span class="locked">a——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was a furniture, office furniture supply house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Now, how big a safe was it that he bought?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was a wall safe, a floor safe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About how high would you say that it stood off the floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About 18 inches tall. The common type that is poured in the
cement in the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this poured in the cement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could somebody, if somebody had broken into the building, could
they have carried this safe away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir. The safe was in his office and the office was always
locked and I was there all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But when you weren’t there, if somebody had gotten into the
building, and had broken into the office, why they could have carried this out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir; they could have carried this out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have the combination of the safe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; Mr. Ruby and Andy was the only ones who had the
combination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After he bought this safe did he use it to keep his money in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. To my knowledge he only used it for the night receipts from the
Carousel Club and Andy when he checked out if Jack wasn’t there, the safe had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
a compartment in the bottom they claimed was a burglarproof compartment in
the bottom, had an envelope slot in it and he, would drop an envelope with
the money in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What would be done with the money at the end of the night?
What would he do with the money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The next day Jack would take the money out and count it up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What would he do with it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He would put it in his pocket and go to the bank.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he bank some place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did he bank?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe, it was the First National, but I am not positive of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you actually go with him to the bank when <span class="locked">he——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; not when he was banking the deposits.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the end of, on a typical week night, about how much money
would he have left, would he have at the end of the night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Oh, a typical night would maybe be anywhere from a $100 to
$500 or $600.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Of course, he had more business on the weekends than he had
during the week, didn’t he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Usually; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Just taking the nights Monday through Thursday, how much
would he typically have on one of those nights?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Between $100 and $300, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is gross, isn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On a weekend night, on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday night
how much would he take in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Anywhere from $100 to maybe $1,000. Depending on the
type of what was doing there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you there any nights that he took in $1,000?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The most I have ever known him to take in was one weekend,
Friday and Saturday night, I believe it was $1,400 for the 2 nights.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you happen to know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I would usually be around when they counted the money up,
and that weekend, I believe Sunday we was talking and Andy said something
about that is the most money they took in any weekend for the last year or
something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he deal with any particular distributor of beer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was the company <span class="locked">that——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He dealt with the different companies, one being the Pearl Beer,
each different brand of beer had different distributors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had its own distributors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about liquor, did he buy hard liquor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, there was no hard liquor sold in the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So his only purchases were beer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Beer, coke and champagne.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who did he buy that from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Most of that was bought to my knowledge from the liquor store
on the corner. I believe it was Segalis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much champagne would he stock any one time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. When he bought champagne he would usually buy a case of 12
bottles and it would usually average about two cases a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did they serve food?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The only food we served was pizzas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was pizzas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Pizzas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were those made at the Carousel or were they sent out from
<span class="locked">those——</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We got those from Palumbo’s Pizza House. All you had to
do was stick them in a warmer and warm them up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So his only expenses—tell me if you can think of any other
expenses besides the one I recite here. He had the expenses of his entertainers,
he had expenses for you and Andy Armstrong, he had rent and heat and light,
and he had beer and pizza. Did he have any other expenses that you can
think of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I would say would be Carousel business expenses, no.
He had a lot of sinking money into things all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What sort of things were those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, he was putting quite a bit of money into this twist board
exerciser that he was promoting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have any other promotions besides the twist board while
you were with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I recall. He would buy records and he had to buy
flashbulbs and film for the camera. He took Polaroid pictures every night,
three of them each night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Three Polaroid pictures each night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; we had one girl who was, I believe it was Tammi True,
would get on the stage and she would get a guy up there with her on the stage
and take a picture of them and give the picture of the man, that was the
only photograph taken and that would go right to the man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, what other business, you say he was always sinking money
into things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, he had the Vegas Club and from what I understand he
was taking money from the Vegas Club to keep the Carousel Club from what
I understood which I never could figure out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why couldn’t you figure that out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, we always made enough to clear our bills, the Carousel
made enough to clear the bills.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. By the bills you include the salaries of the entertainers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Most of that, yes. He was paying pretty good salaries. These
girls got anywhere from $300 to $400, maybe $400, $500 a week for their entertaining.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. They all didn’t get that much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The entertainers, got anywhere from $300 to $500, $600 average,
different.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that just the featured stripper or was that each stripper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Jada was there, I believe, she was drawing $700 a month and the
other girls I think was drawing between $300 and $500, somewhere between
$300 and $500.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. A month?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. A month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. A month. How about “Little” Lynn when she came to work
there, was she getting paid the same as the rest of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so, I am not sure. I don’t know what her wages were,
I am not sure, positive about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Other than the twist boards and the Carousel and the Vegas
Club what other things was Jack putting money into?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. To my knowledge that is all he had. He never seemed to have
any. He always claimed he was going broke all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he actually selling these twist boards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He had never had made any sales while I was with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Before you get into this, let me finish up this financial operation.
I don’t think you have mentioned what the waitresses got.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The waitresses worked on tips.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Purely? There was no expense in connection with that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. To my knowledge, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know if Armstrong got any salary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He got a salary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much was it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not sure. I think he was drawing about $300 a month,
I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then there was a man Howard, the maintenance man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Howard just got paid, whenever he worked he would get paid,
I think a dollar an hour. He didn’t work all the time. He might only get 4 or
5 hours a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much would you estimate in a typical week Ruby took in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. In a typical week it would be anywhere from one to three
thousand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know where these twist boards were manufactured?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. They were manufactured in Houston—Fort Worth, I mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was the name of the company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall the name of the company. I had it wrote down
in my notebook but I don’t recall the name of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember the name of a company called Plastolite
Engineering?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I remember something about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But that wasn’t the name of the company that was manufacturing
the twist boards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It might have been, I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How was Jack trying to sell these twist boards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Like I say, he promoted them out at the fair—State Fair, and
he had a couple of different stores promoting them, and he <span class="locked">had——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You mean they would be on display some place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. And there was some set up, where some of the strippers
went out to one place and done the twist on these twist exercisers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But to your knowledge he never made a sale on one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much would one cost, if you wanted to buy it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The way he was selling them I believe it was two something.
They were selling them in Texas but it was Penney’s, I believe it was Penney’s
store was selling them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In Texas, you mean in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. In Dallas. They were selling them for $3.95 apiece, I think it
was and he was selling his for $2.95 apiece.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack have anybody else associated with him in these twist
boards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was trying to get his one brother to do something with them,
and I believe it was in Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That would have been Hyman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. How is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That would have been Hyman in Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was “Hy,” yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How do you know he was trying to get “Hy” interested in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He had me send some to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I gather from what you have testified to that you have been
around carnivals and you have met a lot of people, and also I think you said
that you form an impression of an individual pretty quickly and have found in
your own experience you have only been wrong once, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I have been wrong twice that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I would like you to tell us what your impression was of Ruby,
and if you can, give us some factual examples and reasons, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, first he was a kind of a likable person. He was kind of
impressable. I mean he impressed me somewhat. I had one instant feeling,
I can’t recollect, more or less the way he talked and his actions that the man
might be somewhat queer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say “queer” you mean what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As the general usage of the term.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean homosexual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What caused you to feel that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The way he talked and his general action.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he effeminate in his method of speaking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. More or less.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have a lisp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What other physical actions that you observed that you think
support or supported your view that he might be homosexual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, mostly just the way he talked and mostly the way he
walked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have any <span class="locked">activity——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. When I first met him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have any activity with his hands or walk or dress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is it, the way a person walks or moves or uses his hands,
involve the appearance of this type of person which I have been in contact with
quite a few of them in the type of things I have been doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So the overall impression that you had from his speech and
from his movement of hands and his walk gave you the impression that he would
fit into the category of people who in your experience were homosexuals?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have occasion to change that view?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Oh, at the same time I kind of liked him, and I never really
went as far as changing that opinion I never really changed it although he
had never made any overtures toward me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him make any overtures toward any man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not to my knowledge, not that I ever saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You heard about some, I suppose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I didn’t. I never heard about any cases where he had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear people express the view that he was homosexual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not people that I met after I went to work for him. But this
friend of mine that met him the same night I did, him and I were pretty well
agreed on the subject that he seemed to be quite that type.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the name of that friend?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t even remember his name. He was a carnival worker,
he worked at the carnival.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was not one of the owners?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just a worker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he was not homosexual himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; he was a pretty straight kid.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you square that off, that opinion of him, with the fact
that he was going out with a girl that you have identified in that Exhibit 5200
A, B, C, D, and E?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I have known several people of this type that were married and
had families.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you didn’t think that was inconsistent with your
former view, your earlier view?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; as far as being inconsistent with my knowledge of that type
of person it isn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it fair to say that your original impression of Ruby that he
might be homosexual still persists to this day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right. Although he was a likable person and I liked him,
and I have got one opinion, I don’t care, I know for sure if a man is that way
if he leaves me alone I can get along fine with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have any friends or acquaintances whom you also thought
were homosexuals?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Which would those people be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. George Senator, for one. He was the only one of his friends
that I met that I really felt that way about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you describe Senator so that we can understand why you
felt he was a homosexual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. More or less from the way he talked more than anything. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
kind of hard for me to explain it because I haven’t got the education to use
the words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We don’t want it—we, the only reason we are taking it this way
is because we don’t want to put words in your mouth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, mostly because of the way he talked, his actions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well now, when you went into Jack’s apartment, did you see
anything in that apartment which would lead you to think that he and George
were having homosexual relationships?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; just general bachelor apartment more than anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you notice that one of the beds had been slept in and the
other hadn’t, for example?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I only saw the bed in Jack’s room. The other bedroom the
door was closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Senator have feminine mannerisms?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Mostly in his speech, at times. It wasn’t all the time but at
times he would have the mannerisms in his speech, the way he uses his hands.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he giggling or what sort of manners?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Oh, a lot about the way he laughed. He would get to talking
about different things and the way his voice would sound more than anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about the topics that you heard Jack and Senator talk
about. Was there anything about the subjects of conversation that they had
which would indicate that they were homosexual or had some sort <span class="locked">of——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. The only thing I could say along that line was that they
was always together, they were together an awful lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Were you able to tell from their relationship whether
one of them was performing services for the other whether in the maintenance
of the household, for example, one of them was assuming responsibilities or the
other wasn’t or taking care of clothes or things like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, most of the cooking Jack done 90 percent, most of the cooking
that was done in the apartment to my knowledge was done by Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, on a couple of occasions Senator—Jack was billing Senator
out because he had cooked something that he shouldn’t have cooked or something,
that—and it was something he didn’t do very often was cook. I can’t
remember the name, what, everything what was said or everything. But it was
to the fact that he didn’t cook anything around the place and when he did cook
it, the few times he did cook he would cook it wrong or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you heard that from having heard Jack remonstrate with
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it fair to state that except for the specific examples you have
given here your impression of both these men, Ruby and Senator concerning
their homosexual tendencies, is based upon your experience with other people
of that same type.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you any other specifics to mention?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That would be about the only thing I could think of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What would you say of Jack concerning his temper, and his reaction
to situations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He had an erratic temper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What do you mean, give us examples, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. You never knew something that you thought would blow him up
might not bother him, something that you thought would not bother him a bit
he would blow up about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Like what? I mean that must be based upon something that
happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Like Andy making a goof with regards to the girls were supposed
to work. They took nights off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, tell us about that so we have it in the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, the first time it happened Jack got pretty mad about it.
The next time it happened, one of the girls was supposed to be there and didn’t
show up, Jack never said a word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say he got mad about it, how did he manifest his anger?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Raising his voice, shouting and calling Andy some “stupid.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack swear, use profanity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Very seldom. When he usually did it was usually “hell” or
“damn.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you any other examples to give us that would throw light
upon his temper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. One day, I was using a vacuum cleaner and it wouldn’t work
and something went wrong with it, something like that, the club has got to be
clean, you would think the man would be kind of perturbed about it and he
wasn’t the least bit bothered about it. I would be cleaning the club and he would
come in while I was cleaning the club, and he would get pretty perturbed because
I was working the vacuum cleaner while he was there and he would yell
at me and make me quit cleaning until he had left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you ever seen him in arguments with other people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. A couple of times with, he got pretty perturbed at the M.C.s, the
one M.C. because of some of the jokes he was telling, some of the stories.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us about that, please, start off with the name of the M.C.,
if you can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember the M.C.s name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember what period of time it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Working for Jack when I went to work for him. He was working
for Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many M.C.s worked during that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About three different M.C.s.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This was the one who was working when you first went to work
with it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He had quite a habit of telling racial jokes and Jack was pretty
much against this and on several occasions he got pretty perturbed with the M.C.
for telling the racial jokes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say pretty perturbed, you see that doesn’t tell us
about what he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. To the point where he went in among the chairs right by the
stage and was yelling at the M.C.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that he could be heard all over the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. Very definitely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And yelling, by yelling you mean that his voice was raised above
the normal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Very much so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was he saying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Telling him, you know, “I don’t like that kind of jokes in here.”
He said, stuff like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What kind of jokes were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Racial jokes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well about what race?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Colored people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About the colored people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; Jack was against a racial joke of any type, very much so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you find that out from him or just from this occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. From these different occasions like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ever tell you himself that he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; not personally, but from the way he acted on different occasions
like that that would happen he would chew the M.C. out pretty good
for telling the racial jokes and for some pretty vulgar jokes he told, on occasions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean he objected to vulgar jokes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; he said that his objection was the club was no place for that
real vulgar type of joke.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By vulgar you mean a joke that dealt with sex?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; joke that would leave no doubt in a person’s mind that it
was a sexual joke. Some of them that he told were just that type of joke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean abnormal sex?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So what he objected to were jokes that had to do with abnormal
sex, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, there was, I think on one or two occasions there was, the
M.C. told jokes of an abnormal sex, but there was things that were real vulgar
jokes where he was cussing a lot or something in a joke he didn’t care for too
much. He don’t like the foul language used in the club very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about—these comedians must have told sexual jokes, didn’t
they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Oh, yes; that is one of the things that put a comedian over in that
kind of a club; they are there to sell sex, and if they don’t tell a sexual joke
the comedian is nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How do you distinguish for us between the kind of sexual jokes
that Jack would be upset about and those he accepted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. [Deleted.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that the type of joke that Ruby objected to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That type of joke would be acceptable because it leaves a person
to figure out in his own mind what the deal is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind would be objectionable?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. [Deleted.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That would be an objectionable joke?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; because there would be no question in anybody’s mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that a specific example, or one that you were using?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. An example; the joke was not told in the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From what you have told us as a generalization it would seem
to be this, that any joke that left it to the imagination of the listener would be
all right with Jack, but if it was specific he objected to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right. It was pretty well acceptable all over the country
that way. You take even with a party joke. If a party joke leaves in a person’s
mind in most places, leaves it to a person to imagine it themselves, it is
acceptable. But if there isn’t any doubt it doesn’t make it acceptable in a mixed
party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Larry, did you learn anything that would indicate whether Jack’s
attitude about these jokes was based on any concern about what the local law-enforcement
people would feel about having such jokes told in his club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t—I can’t think of anything that would make me feel
that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it your impression of his being perturbed, as the way you
put it, was sincere or possibly just part of the act?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It seemed pretty sincere to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He never did tell you, man to man, that he objected to these?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack tell any jokes himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall of any. I think a couple of times he got on the
stage and tried to M.C. and fell sort of flat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about privately; was Jack the kind of person who would
joke and tell jokes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He never did that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Jack the kind of person who would sit around with the
comedians and talk with them in between acts and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; Jack was the kind that the only time he would say anything
to the comedians was if he done something he didn’t like, and if Jack wanted
the comedian to do something he would say something to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever notice any traits of physical violence in Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The one time I noticed any traits of physical violence at all,
there was a guy came to the club who was pretty well polluted, and I think
Ralph Paul was sitting right near the door, and he started giving the doorman
a bad time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who <span class="locked">started——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. This drunk fellow did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Ralph had to get him to leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Ralph was sitting right there and he asked the gentleman to
leave and he wouldn’t do it, and Jack went over there and the gentleman struck
Ralph Paul and when he did Jack just pushed his arm down and pushed him
out the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He didn’t hit him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you form any impression about Ralph Paul, as to whether
Ralph Paul was a homosexual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; Ralph was a pretty good, decent guy. I liked him, what
little I did know of him. I like him. He was kind of a stuffed shirt, but he was
a fair, likable guy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you notice if Jack’s club was visited by any people who would
appear to you to be homosexuals?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I didn’t notice that. I can’t recall of any specific people
coming in that would appear to be this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack ever talk to you about sex?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; very seldom; one or two occasions when I said something
about a girl or something, when I said something about a girl or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was his interest in his dogs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Sheba was the only one that really meant a lot to him. He was
like a lot of people who are alone, and get with animals.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You mean he was attached to them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Really attached.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. To Sheba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he breed Sheba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. Sheba had been bred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this something that he did, or did he send her some place
to be bred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he took her to another place, another place to be bred;
I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there anything, any experience you had which indicated
he had any sexual interest in these dogs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I wouldn’t say so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever see him try to sexually stimulate these dogs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I ever saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever hear anything in that regard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now the example you gave us about Ruby putting the man out
at the club is the only one that you ever perceived as an act of physical violence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Where he actually used physical violence. I have seen him
where he was close to it at another M.C. at one time. Threatened for him to go
out or he would throw him out, which was something which occurred every 2 or 3
months with other M.C.’s.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there any occasions when you say that Jack handled a situation
that could have involved violence but did not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, the situation where he told that M.C. to get out. It could
have really involved violence, Jack’s just; he was about ready to grab the guy,
and he just turned and walked away from him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Jack walked away from that man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never saw him hit anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. The only time I even saw him touch anybody was when
he got the man’s hand and knocked it down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was the comedian bigger than Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; bigger than Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Quite a bit bigger?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How about the patron that he handled?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was a bigger fellow. He stood about 6 foot. He is quite
a bit bigger than I am, even. He was taller and heavier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know anything about what Ruby did to keep in physical
condition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I knew he worked with barbells quite a lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He told me about his barbells a couple of times and he was
dieting, and I had heard that he went to a gymnasium quite often.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he seem to you to be a powerful man, considering his build
and weight and size?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. For his type of build and flabbiness as he was, he had quite a
bit of strength.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. <span class="locked">Well——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I mean did you observe him in a situation which demonstrated
the use of strength?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; not really where it would be a real test of strength or anything.
I have never seen anything of that sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I was just wondering how you formed the impression that he
was a pretty strong man, considering his size.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, for as heavy a man as he was, he was pretty solid for one
thing; he was fairly solid.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You could tell that by looking at him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I suppose you have seen him with his coat off or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I saw him with just his pants and a T-shirt on, or an undershirt
and pants, on one occasion when I went to his house. He shaved and he said
something and I stepped over to the bathroom door; I couldn’t hear. He repeated
it and I stepped back and sat down and watched television and then he
went ahead and got cleaned up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he carry a gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He had one in the car. He very seldom carried it on his person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did he keep it in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Usually in the trunk; it was in a money pouch, a money sack,
which usually stayed in the trunk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say he didn’t carry it on his person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see it on his person or know it was there in some
way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir; one night that I knew for sure it was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What night was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall the date, but something happened, and Jack sent
me down to the car to get the gun and bring it up to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there some trouble in the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember whether it was right in the Carousel or
whether it was a phone call or what it was, really. There was something
<span class="locked">there——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He told you something that indicated he ought to have the gun,
and he asked you to go get it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He sent me down after the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he just simply send you down after the gun, or did he tell you
that there was something that had happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He sent me down after the gun. Something happened right
there at the club. I <span class="locked">can’t——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it some sort of a disturbance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I can’t recall just what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this an incident that other people would have been aware
of; Andy Armstrong might have been aware of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe Andy Armstrong was right there at the time. I believe
most any of the girls who worked for him were aware of it at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did I misunderstand you? Did you say this incident where you
were sent for the gun was preceded by a phone call?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not sure. He had been on the phone and then he went
outside and then something happened at the club; he had an argument or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did he do after you brought the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was right there and the club was closed and I didn’t see him
until the next day. He seemed pretty angry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He didn’t try to throw anybody out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was George Senator there at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember how close this incident was to the death of
the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was either a week before or the same week, earlier the same
week, that President Kennedy was assassinated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it a weekday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. It was during the week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was not on a weekend?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; it was during the week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So it would have been sometime between the 17th, say, of November
and prior to the 22d, or it would have been sometime between the 11th
and the 15th of November; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever noticed any incidents of Ruby that would throw
some light on whether he was a person who had a trait of kindness or benevolence
toward other people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was quite kindhearted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Give us an example of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. One example was the way he took me in. He had no reason for
doing it. He wasn’t obligated to do it in any way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You think you earned your pay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think you earned your pay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think I earned everything I got.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you still think it was an act of kindness on his part to take
you in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think he was doing me a favor, and still in all he was getting
some pretty cheap work, labor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ask him for the job or did he ask you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He asked me. And then I know of another occasion where I
was told about of this young fellow he took in didn’t do a thing around the club
and he had him around there for 3 or 4 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did it seem to you that Jack felt it was important that he have
somebody at the club all the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. After I was there for a while he seemed to feel that way. At
first, when I first got to know him, he didn’t seem to feel that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This boy that had been there more or less doing the job that you
did, but was there prior to you; did you know this fellow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I didn’t know him. I had heard—Andy had told me about
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Isn’t it a fact that you heard from Andy or otherwise there had
been some trouble between Ruby and that man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe there was something said about trouble.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Isn’t it a fact that you heard that Ruby pistol-whipped him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I can’t recall of ever hearing that statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear that this boy was Jewish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir. I had no idea; no knowledge of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never met him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I understand that there came a time when you asked Jack to put
you on a different pay basis than you originally were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. When I went to work it was on the understanding that I eventually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
would be with him a Little while and then I would start being on a salary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long were you with him? Well, let me put it this way:
Did there come a time when you began to ask to be put on salary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Because I felt that the way things were, I didn’t have any
private life of my own. He wanted to tell me what I could do, who I could talk
to, and who I couldn’t talk to if he put me on a salary where I was maybe making
$35 or $40 a week I could live on my own, which I would much prefer to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. $35 or $40 plus the opportunity to live at the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As long as it was $35 or $40, period. I could live on my own;
for the work I done at the club, I could live on my own.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. How long had you been with Jack before you started
to ask him about this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I probably had been with him about 4 or 5 weeks. That was
about 2 weeks before President Kennedy was assassinated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did Jack say when you mentioned that to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He said he would see what he could do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What do you mean by that? What did you understand by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, he said what he could do; he would figure his bookwork
out and see what he could do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you remind him of the fact that he had told you that at the
beginning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 12:10 p.m., the proceeding recessed.)</p>

<h3>TESTIMONY OF CURTIS L. CRAFARD RESUMED</h3>

<p>The proceeding reconvened at 1:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Mr. Crafard, this is a continuation of the deposition which
was recessed for the lunch hour. You understand that we are continuing this
deposition by the same authority that we commenced it with, and likewise that
you are under the same oath that you were under and that you took at the
beginning of that deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that agreeable to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when did you first hear that the President was going to
visit Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was about 3 or 4 weeks before he came to Dallas.
It was advertised in the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you working for Ruby at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir; it came out in the papers that showed the proposed
route and the proposed secondary route of this trip through the city.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you saying that the first time you found out that he, President
Kennedy, was going to visit the city, was when you read it in the newspapers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that in that account that you read in the newspapers, the
proposed route and an alternate route was given?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That would have been just a very few days before he actually
came, wouldn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that was at least a week before he came that that came
out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At any rate, whatever day the proposed route came out in the
papers that was the first day that you found out that the President was coming to
Dallas at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. They had been thinking he was going to come to Dallas. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
said something about it, but there was nothing definite at that time, I didn’t
know anything definite about it until I read it in the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had read something in the paper about his coming prior to
the time that the route was set out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There was something in the paper about it figured he would
come or something but so far as I can recall there was nothing definite until
that same issue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, did you ever talk to Ruby about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. There wasn’t much said about it in the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was anything said about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Something the day the paper came out with the proposed route,
we all said something about the fact that he was coming to town, Dallas, that
it would probably help Dallas a little bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Help in what way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Maybe bring a few more conventions or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who said that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We all discussed it, Andy and Jack and I.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Including Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember specifically a conference, or conversation,
rather, of which there were three, at least, Jack Ruby and Andy Armstrong,
at which it was mentioned that it was a good thing for Dallas because it would
bring more conventions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was in the paper, when Jack came to the club we already
had the paper there and Jack came to the club and he read the paper and said
something about it and then he said something to the effect that it might help
Dallas a little bit because it might bring more conventions to Dallas, or something
to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was the day that the paper came out with the route?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you talked to Ruby about the President’s visit prior to that
day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you talked to anyone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t let me finish my question. Had you talked to anyone
else about the fact that the President might be coming to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall anything about it, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say there was no conversation in the club about it
other than what you have testified <span class="locked">to——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. None that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was any mention made of the fact that in any conversation between
you and Jack or anybody else about the fact that the parade would pass
near the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There was something said that we only have to walk a block,
I think, or something like that, up where we could see the parade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who said that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember whether it was Andy or myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could it have been Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It might have been. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case, either you or Andy made such a remark, and was
Jack present when it was made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he was; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have a distinct recollection of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t have a distinct recollection; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it on the same occasion that you mentioned earlier that
he came in and said about how it would improve the business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was the day before the President’s trip, arrival in
Dallas, Andy and I had been saying something about wanting to see it and
some one of us said something about it was only about a block or something like
that to go to see it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ask Jack’s permission to leave to go watch it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think we both told Jack that we was going to go watch it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You and Andy did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; we didn’t figure on going. Andy was taking the day off
so he could go and I told Jack I was figuring going on up and watching the
parade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he say about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He didn’t say anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall him saying anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were asking <span class="locked">him——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Other than maybe telling me it was all right to go or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is what I was wondering. Did he express any consent
or disapproval?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall what he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he mention what he was going to do about watching it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell him where you were going to watch it, yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You recall, of course, the day that the President was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall the night before that, which would have been
Thursday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As far as I can recall it was more or less a general night for
the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there any special preparations by way of preparing
for a larger crowd or for some program in connection with the President’s visit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, the night prior to the President’s visit was a
routine night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As far as I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I suppose you have put your mind to it since, particularly at the
time it happened, because most people did, you know. They relate that historic
event to their own lives and reconstruct what they were doing before and
afterwards.</p>

<p>Did you do that? Have you ever done that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I have tried to think of what I was doing before, the night
before, a couple nights before, or something like that. I don’t recall anything
out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If it was the ordinary, then I suppose it would have been that
the club were closed up at its usual hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As far as I recall, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you were still sleeping there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I was still sleeping there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you would have gone to sleep?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then I suppose Ruby would have wakened you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Andy woke me that morning. He come in early. Andy always
put the beer in and he come in early to do that so that he could have the rest
of the day off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did Andy come in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think it was about 9:30 or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Came in personally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. He was there when the President was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you asleep when he came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was asleep when he came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you waken up when he came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I didn’t wake up—Andy woke me up and told me that the
President had been shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was much later in the day, wasn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About 12:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Weren’t you suppose to be doing your cleaning-up job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Ordinarily if I had been up, I would have been cleaning up;
yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Ordinarily he would have awakened you when he came in,
wouldn’t he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Andy, when he came in he should have woke me up. I guess
he said he had called me or something and I hadn’t woke up, I hadn’t got up
or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Didn’t he know you wanted to go and see the parade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He knew I said something about it. I don’t know, I think maybe
he had been down and saw us—down to see some of it or something and then
come back to the club or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t leave word for anyone to call you to see the parade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Wasn’t it unusual for you to sleep that length of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not if I was tired and they didn’t call me, I’d sleep if they didn’t
call me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever done that before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I’ve seen the time when I went to sleep and slept 14 or 15 hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No, I am talking about while you were at the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. At the club a couple times I slept until 1:30 or 2 o’clock in
the afternoon before somebody woke me up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had made no plans yourself to anticipate going to see the
President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not definite plans except if I got up I figured I’d go down and
see it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you intended to get up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I figured I’d wake up. I didn’t wake up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you go to bed, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know, about 2:30 or 3 o’clock, or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You slept clean around until 12:30 or after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know Andy came in earlier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The beer was all taken care of, so I figured he had been in the
club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are not sure It was Andy that did that, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Put the beer on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Andy said something about doing it, he had done it earlier, or
something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was the beer normally delivered at a regular time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We had the beer delivered 2 days a week. Andy come in every
day and put the beer in the cooler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was the beer delivered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was delivered upstairs when it was delivered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did somebody have to receive it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was it delivered that day, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was delivered on Tuesdays and Saturdays, I believe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It wasn’t delivered on this day, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, but he come up to put more beer in the cooler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was his job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. He done that all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t have anything to do with it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where would he carry the beer from, from what place to where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It would come in the front door of the club, there was a hallway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span>
off to the side here and come on over here and made an L. My room was
here and he’d get the beer over here and take it out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He had to pass your room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He had to pass by it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He would come in the back of the club where the beer was
stored?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Probably he’d come in the front door and go up here and get the
beer. My room was down here on this corner, and he would get the beer here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you leave the door open or closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. My door was closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why was it closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I closed it all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Weren’t you supposed to be sort of on guard, as it were, in
addition to doing the job around there, that is part of your job having someone
on the premises?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I just figured having me sleep there, I guess. He never said
anything to me about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ever awaken you oh other days when he brought the
beer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. If Andy came in when I was still in bed he’d usually wake me
up, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But he did not this morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He said he called me but I hadn’t woke up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He called you by telephone or in person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know whether he called me by telephone, he said he
tried to call me by telephone or called me when he come to the club or what.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If he called you by telephone where would the telephone have
been in reference to your room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. In the room next to my room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you hear it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you ever been awakened before by it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, several times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is no doubt then that if he had called you by telephone
it would have awakened you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. More likely I figured it would have, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course if he had tried to wake you by calling you, just
through the door, that would have awakened you, I assume.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I might have roused up, spoke to him and answered him and
then got back down without even knowing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember it. I say I might have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did he tell you that he called you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was shortly after he did wake me up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did he wake you up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He come in there and he had his radio up real loud when he
come in there and he told me the President had been shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was at what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He called me two or three times. It was just after the President
had been shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many times did he call you? You said two or three times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He called me two or three times at that time when he woke
me up there he called me two or three times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He said so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t recall it two or three times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I recall hearing him call me twice that I know of right then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then that aroused you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you been drinking the night before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I am trying to get at, Larry, is why it was so difficult
to wake you that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I can understand that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you any explanation for it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. None that I can think of except that I probably was a little
tired, except a little tired from the night before when I went to bed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You do recall that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I went to bed and went right to sleep. I didn’t lie awake
very long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you normally lay awake sometimes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I normally lay awake anywhere from an hour and a half to 2
hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But this particular night you did not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You weren’t drinking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, not that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you drink much?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Very seldom. I drank, I think, three or four different times
while I was there that I drank a beer or two, that was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that your heavy sleep on the morning of the 22d couldn’t
be attributed to the fact that you had a hangover?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or that you were suffering from any overindulgence in alcohol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t take any kind of sleeping pills or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So this was just normal sleep?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And his call failed to wake you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he tell you when he first came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The first thing he said was President Kennedy had been shot.
He said, “The President has been shot.” I wouldn’t hardly believe him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Immediately we went in and turned the television on. He had
his radio going and I turned the television on and listened to his radio and
then we had to turn the television up real loud where we could hear it. We
were more interested in what was said than the pictures they was showing or
anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember what time it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was something <span class="locked">like——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean first of all when he woke you up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. 20 or 25 to 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To 12?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Or after 12, to 1, I mean. I think it was something like that.
I’m not sure. I didn’t have a watch on. I didn’t have a watch at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You began looking at the television. I suppose from the time
that you woke up plus the time it took you to get dressed, or did you get dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As soon as he woke me up he went in and turned the television
on while I was putting my pants on, putting my clothes on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember what was the first thing you saw on television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it a news commentator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember which one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the station it was on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t remember what station it was on, either.</p>

<p>It was one of the local—I believe it was 12 that Dallas-Fort Worth—I believe
that was the station.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was a Dallas station or a Fort Worth station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It is one there they call the Dallas-Fort Worth, WWTV12, I
think it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. KLRD, is that what it is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know what station it is. I am not sure whether it
was WWTV.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you stay there watching?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We turned it up real loud where we could hear it and then
listened to his radio, too, where we would hear both of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Go ahead, what happened next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall exactly what was said except the fact that the
President had been shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you continue to watch it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We watched it right up until—most of the day, I think, we had
the television on there, then, most of the day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you do any of your work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Oh, I started to clean up. When Jack come in he said not to.
He said, “We’re going to close the club for the weekend.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did he come in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was about 2 or 2:30, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About 2 hours after, do you think?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About that; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us what happened, how he looked, what he said and all
that, when he came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was like everybody else, shocked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did he manifest that shock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. How is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did he manifest the shock? What did he do or say that
gave you the impression that he was suffering from shock like everybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About the same thing as any of us said. We couldn’t really
believe it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he crying, for example?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He seemed to be very nervous. As far as really being crying, I
couldn’t say for sure he had been crying. He wasn’t crying at the time, anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was his nervousness, or his shock greater than, say, that which
you could observe in Armstrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I believe it was. He was much nervouser than Andy or I,
either one was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, how did that come across to you, by what he said or did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It come across that it struck him pretty deep that Kennedy
had been assassinated, had been shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You see you have to get that impression from him in one of two
ways. Either he said something or he did things, and that is what I want
to find out, what he said or he did that creates an impression that now remains
in your mind as being one of more shock than anybody else, and as you put it,
extreme nervousness. You don’t get that impression except what you saw or
you heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now that is what I want to find out, because it is one thing to
have your impression but it is another thing to have what caused your impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. He couldn’t believe it had happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He said so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What else did he do that was out of the ordinary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was trying to think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he cry? You said a moment ago he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He said it was an outrageous crime, that it would ruin the city
of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say why, in what way it would ruin it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The fact that the President had been shot there in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would ruin it how?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As far as nightclubs, nightclub activity was concerned, for all
nightclubs concerned, it would pretty well pull a lot of the conventions away,
and such as that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that when Ruby came back and expressed his concern about
the shooting of the President, he adverted to the fact that that crime would
hurt Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would hurt the convention business and would hurt his business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He just said all nightclubs. He said the nightclub business in
general, I believe, more than his personal business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he specifically advert to how that would affect the Carousel
and the Vegas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I can recall.</p>

<p>Andy and I both, I believe it was myself that made the statement that the
guy, whoever had done that, had ought to hang, or something to that effect,
and we was all pretty much in agreement on that subject. Our agreement on
that was about the same.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, in this conference, I call it conference, I mean
meeting that you and Andy and Jack had together, which commenced about 2
hours after the President’s assassination, you discussed the fact that it was a
terrible crime, that it would hurt the city and the nightclub business and
that the man who did it ought to be punished?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And Jack was a part of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; we was all pretty much in agreement on that. We agreed
to the fact it <span class="locked">would——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know at that time who had done it or who was suspected
of having done it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that earlier on the news, or something, I believe they
suspected Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had he been mentioned by name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he had; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was prior to the time Ruby came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so, I’m not definite on that, but I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, Ruby came in, you are quite sure, about 2 hours after
you heard of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About 2 hours, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you heard of it at a little after 12:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; just shortly after it happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So Jack told you that there is no use cleaning up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. He said, “We’re going to close the club for the weekend.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he propose to do about the cleaning up job as to the
club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just leave it go until Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just let it stay as it was until Monday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he so told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had he made up his mind at that time to close the club for
the entire weekend?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he just said for Friday and Saturday night at that
time. He said something about cleaning up later on, or something, and then
he come back later and he left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s see, how long did he stay, before we get to this point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was there maybe a half hour or 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What else did he do there besides converse with you as you
have already testified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That was about it right there, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he make any phone calls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he called his sister. I’m not sure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember that, yourself, or do you think perhaps you
picked that up from reading about it somewhere?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I believe that he called his sister on the phone right by the
front door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean that is the public phone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. We had three business phones on the same line in the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The same number, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, with the same number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But there were different lines, you could make different calls
from them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There was one phone with three extensions then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Two extensions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Two extensions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there a public phone there, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The public phone was in the back in the hallway. I believe he
called his sister from the front door phone there and talked to her and he told
her he was coming over, or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You overheard that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was either at that time or later in the afternoon when he
come back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On that first time that he was there, which was from 2:30 to
about 3:15—would that be a fair estimate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About 3:15 or 3:30, or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s do this. You mentioned a moment ago that he came in
about 2:30 and stayed about a half hour to three-quarters of an hour. He
came at 2:30 and left at about 3:30.</p>

<p>Then there is a possibility he stayed there an hour on his first visit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He might have been there anywhere between a half hour and
three-quarters of an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Anyway, roughly between 3 and 3:30 is when he left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And during that period he made one phone call, or you are not
sure of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not positive. I think he did, but I am not positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If it should turn out that he did not call his sister on that
occasion, do you recall any other phone calls that he made during the first visit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I’m not sure. It seems like there was a phone call to his
brother or something that he called long distance either then or later in the
day or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you know he had called long distance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Because he had me get the address, get the number or something.
He had me give him the phone number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of which brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was the brother in Chicago—in Detroit, the Cobo
Laundry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are talking about Earl, aren’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He did not have Earl’s number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He had it, he had it in his book at home, and I had it wrote
down in the book of phone numbers there in the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you then gave him the number, or dialed for him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I gave it to him, I believe, and he dialed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were present when he dialed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Andy and I were both there in the main part of the club where
he was at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There was no one else in the club at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; just Andy and I.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know why he didn’t use his office phone?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I have no idea, except that during the day when there was
nobody else there he would more frequently use the front phone than he would
the office phone. We’d been out there talking. We could all three—he’d have
the table space to work and everything, count his money out, figure out the papers,
and everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are unable to fix the time of that call to his brother, is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did he come back after having left at, roughly, between 3
and 3:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He come back about, I believe, about 4:30 or 5 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it fair to say that he was gone about an hour to an hour and
a half?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I would say so. He asked me if I wanted to go to his sister’s
with him. He made quite a point of it, and I told him I’d prefer to stay at
the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What do you mean by making quite a point of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He asked me two or three times about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did it strike you as odd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; it just struck me as if he kind of wanted me to go. He
thought it wouldn’t be—didn’t think it would be very good for me to stay there
at the club by myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I have no idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you that he <span class="locked">thought——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He said he thought it would be better for me to go with him
than to stay at the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ask him why he had such thought?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I didn’t. I didn’t think about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you think of the nature of that remark to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It didn’t have no effect on me whatsoever at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had stayed at the club alone before, hadn’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Didn’t you think it rather odd that he would suggest in some
way that it wouldn’t be proper for you to stay at the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. At that time it didn’t strike me at all. I didn’t even think about
it. I was still pretty shook up, myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you been doing any work in the interval when he was gone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; not that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he make any phone calls when he came back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he called his sister at that time. I’m not positive, but
I believe he called her at that time and told her he’d be right over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did he leave after having returned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was only there for about 10 or 15, maybe 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he call his sister twice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He called her then, I’m almost positive that he called her that
time and told her he’d be right over.</p>

<p>I told him that I’d prefer to stay at the club because, well, I knew his sister
was highly emotional from what little I had talked to her on the telephone a
couple of times, she called for Jack and she always seemed very nervous on the
phone and everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As I understand you now, it is quite clear that he did call his
sister Eva?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When he came back the second time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I’m almost positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is when he stayed about 10 minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He left about 4:30 or 5, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Having stayed there only 10 minutes, whatever time he did come?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He stayed only 10 or 15 minutes. He hadn’t been there very
long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From the time that you first heard of the President’s death until
he left that second time to go to his sister’s, had he called his sister once or
twice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe, that was the second time he called her that day, I’m
not positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that the first call must have been through the first, during
the first visit, mustn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I believe so, because he only made the one phone call when
he came back the last time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, with relation to the call to his brother, is your memory
fresh now as to whether that call was made during his first visit between 2:30
and 3 o’clock, 2:30 and 3:30, or on his second visit when he stayed 10 minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That was made on the first visit, I’m almost positive of that.
I can only recall of one phone call he made and that was to his sister when he
come back the second time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was there only 10 minutes, he called her and he asked you
several times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He asked me two or three times to go with him and I told him
I’d rather not because she was highly nervous and I didn’t care to be around her.
I hardly <span class="locked">never——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he say to you about being worried about your staying
at the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He just thought it would be better for me to be with somebody
than to be by myself, I guess, because I was shook up, kind of shook up about
what had happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How were you showing that? I mean, what manifestations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I guess more or less a look in my face, or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he seem to indicate that he feared for your safety?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; not that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But what you are telling us is that at the time you had no reaction
whatsoever to that suggestion of his that it would be better for you not to
stay at the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I had no reaction at all to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know whether he meant your safety or your own personal
feelings or really what he meant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t ask him what he meant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So he just then openly allowed you to stay on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was Armstrong still there during that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; Andy—I was alone at the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did Andy leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Andy left just shortly after Jack had left the first time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what, 5 or 10 minutes after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About maybe 10 or 15 minutes later. When Jack was there
the second time before he left, he give me a sign, he told me to make up a sign
that said we’d be closed Friday and Saturday, put it downstairs about 6:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you do it in pencil or pen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I made it with pencil and put it downstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that before or after he asked you <span class="locked">to——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That was after he left the second time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; you misunderstood my question. Did he ask you to make
that sign before or after he asked you to go to Eva’s with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe, that was afterwards, after the first stay there at the
club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he give you any instructions as to what to do?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Make up a sign that we’d be closed. He had a closed sign. He
said, “Take it down there and put it downstairs about 7:30 or quarter to eight”,
and he said, “Wait until the other clubs open. Let them”—he said, I think it
was, “Let them damn guys stay open”, or something to that effect, quite similar
to the wording there, I’m not sure what the wording was, that wording was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He got over to you, though, that he was going to close, that he
wanted you to prepare and put up a sign, but to do it in such a way that his
competitors wouldn’t know he was anticipating that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you so in so many words?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He said, wait until they opened before I put it up. He said
something like “Let those damn fools open if they want”, or something to that
effect, or “Stay open”, or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he give you any other instructions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That was about it. He asked me where I was going to eat and
I told him and he said something about he’d call me in about an hour. He
said to go ahead and eat then and he said “I’ll call you in about an hour.”</p>

<p>So he called me—I don’t even remember what he said then. It was just I
guess he asked me if there had been any phone calls or something. It wasn’t
much. The conversation wasn’t but about a dozen words at most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had there been any phone calls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; not while I was at the club. I waited until about 30 minutes
after he left and then I went to eat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you eat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. To the drugstore, Walgreen Drugstore.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You ate alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You came back to the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; that’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time was it when you got back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It must have been about 6:20 or 6:30, something like that, I
guess—a little later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you next hear from Ruby or see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I never saw him again until the next morning. He called me
from Eva’s, talked with me for a few minutes, about an hour after he left. I
just got back from eating.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know he was at Eva’s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He said he was at Eva’s, and then I could hear her voice. They
was watching on television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the subject of that conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. So far as I can recall, he just asked me if there had been any
calls, as far as I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you simply told him no?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ask you about the sign?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I told him I had it ready and he made sure, he told me again
what time—not to put it up until after about 7:30 or a quarter to eight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did that conversation last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was just a very few minutes. It couldn’t have been more
than two dozen words spoken at the most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he give you any indication as to what his plans were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say anything about going to church?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I can recall. I think he said something about I could
reach him at Eva’s if I needed him for anything, I think he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And this you think was between 6:15 and 6:30, or long in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I prefer to say between 6:30 and 7.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do with the rest of the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I stayed at the club and watched it on television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nobody else came at all?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. The door was locked downstairs, nobody could get up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you put up the sign?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I waited until about a quarter to eight before I put up the sign.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were the other clubs open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe they were closed too. I am not sure. I am not positive
about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any phone calls come at all the rest of the evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were there alone that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You just watched television until you went to bed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I watched television for quite a while. I watched television
most of the afternoon. It seemed like the more I watched it, the worse it
made me feel, in a way, so I just quit watching it. I had a couple of books
there and I read most of the afternoon and the evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you go to bed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I must have went to bed probably about 9 or 9:30, something
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And there were no phone calls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I can recall. I believe there was—about midnight
I believe it was, there was a call. I don’t even know why this girl called.
I don’t even know why she called. I talked to her for a few minutes and then
I took the phone out of the office. It had a big long cord on it and I carried it
in by my bed. I stretched out on the bed and we talked for quite a long time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was the girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t even remember her name. I had never met her before
or ever heard from her again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who did she say she was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She give me her name. I don’t remember what her name was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did she say her business was, why did she call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think she said something about wanting a job with the
club or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was not a girl that worked at the club in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; she was not connected with the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think she did identify herself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I know she identified herself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you don’t remember who she was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had never seen her before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. I had never met the girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t recognize the name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you recognize the voice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As far as you could say then this was a complete stranger to
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you speak to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Oh, we must have talked altogether for about an hour, an hour
and a half, and then hung up, and about 15 or 20 minutes she called back and
talked for a couple of hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now you talked to this girl for a total of about 3 hours that
night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was it all about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just more or less talking, getting acquainted. More than
anything over the phone, the best I could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she indicate where she was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She was baby sitting for a friend of hers. She give me to
understand she was to catch a bus out of town the next morning, about 5:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In the course of the conversation did you try to find out why she
had called the Carousel?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She called, she said, to start with, when we first started
talking, she had called to find out about a job in the club. I don’t know why
she done it that way—that is what she said, as far as I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was she aware that the President was dead?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes: I believe we discussed that a little bit too. T don’t recall
what was said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The first time you spoke to her, you said it was about midnight—right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had been asleep?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I had just started dozing off when the phone rang.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you spoke to her then about an hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I believe—I’m not sure—I think Little Lynn called.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did she call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just the one time that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that was about 9:30 or 10 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did she say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. After I laid down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did she want?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She wanted to talk to Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she tell you what about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; she just said it was urgent. I believe I told her Jack was at
Eva’s and give her Eva’s number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She was at her home in Fort Worth, as I understood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that a long-distance call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any other workers, waitresses or girls come in that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, none. Jack had had Andy call all of them to tell them not
to come in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now when you ended the conversation with this girl that
began about midnight, was there an arrangement for one or the other of you
to call up again in a few minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I told her I’d like to talk to her again. I told her I’d
like to meet her. I told her I’d like to get acquainted with her. I tried to
get her to talk a little longer. She said she had to hang up. And then she
called me back 15 or 20 minutes later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then you continued to talk for a couple of hours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did that end up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Some one of the younger kids there woke up or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you made any arrangement to meet her, to see her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; no definite arrangements. I tried to get her to tell me
what bus station she was leaving out of. She wouldn’t even tell me what
bus station she was leaving out of. I told her I’d meet her before she caught
the bus, but she wouldn’t tell me where she was leaving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This conversation in fact, Larry, was kind of a love making
on the phone deal, wasn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. More or less what you might say an attempt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And part of that attempt of course would be trying to find out
who she was and where you could meet her, wouldn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Who she was and where I could meet her at her likes and her dislikes,
such as that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She wouldn’t tell you any of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, she wouldn’t tell me where I could meet her at or anything,
but other than we really talked as if we known each other for months,
actually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t write down her name, Larry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think I wrote her name down, but I never could get her
phone number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you write it down?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I wrote it down in that notebook I had. I’m not
sure. I don’t have her name now. I never had her name after I left Texas,
I know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you recognize that name in the notebook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I’m not even sure of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We will have an opportunity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did she sound like a young girl? How old a person was she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe she said she was 19, 18 or 19 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She told you, didn’t she, that she had to be at the bus station
at 5 o’clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was 5, 5:30 or 6 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is only one bus station there, isn’t there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Two bus stations, Trailways and Greyhound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you find out which one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She wouldn’t tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she tell you what time the bus was going to leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think she said something about she had to leave where she was
at 5:30 or 6 o’clock to catch the bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To catch the bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. To catch the bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To go where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think she said she was going to Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you try to find out what buses from either station were
leaving around that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I didn’t call the bus depots or anything. I wasn’t that
interested in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you were interested enough in her to talk with her for
3 hours. I wondered if you weren’t interested enough to find out if you
couldn’t meet her by going to one of the bus stations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She talked—she was leaving town and didn’t figure on being
back for quite a little while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did she tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Shortly after we started—I believe just shortly before we
finished the conversation I started to find out where to meet her at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which was it? What killed your interest? Is that what you
are trying to tell us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I figured she was leaving town, there wasn’t no sense in going
to too much trouble to try and meet her if she was leaving town and wasn’t figuring
on being back.</p>

<p>First, she talked like she was going to be gone for the weekend, and then
just shortly before we finished the conversation, she give me to understand
that she would be gone on a prolonged, for a prolonged period of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So this girl then, who was going for a long period of time, you
suggest was willing to talk with you for 3 hours and the conversation, the
general tenor of which was sort of love making on the phone, as it were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As you would put it; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you find out or try to find out her phone number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I asked for her—I tried to get her phone number where she was
at. I tried to get her home phone number. I tried to get her address. She
wouldn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She wouldn’t give you any of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you give us any idea what subject you could possibly have
talked about for that length of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Mostly we discussed our different hobbies, our likes and dislikes.
Like I say, the conversation was more as if we had known each other
for 2 or 3 weeks or better.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You must have made more than one effort to try to get her phone
number and her address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Several times I tried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What reason did she ascribe for not giving it to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She said she was at a neighbor’s place. She was babysitting
for some friends of hers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; but you had asked her for her home address as well?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Her home phone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She just wouldn’t give me any reason for not giving me her home
phone number that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s see, that means that she was a person who was going out of
town and did not want to talk to you any more, and didn’t want to give you her
number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or where you could reach her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But she spoke to you for 3 hours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Larry, when she called did she ask for anyone in particular?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She asked if it was the Carousel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And then what did she say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. And I said yes, and I asked her if there was something I could
do for her. I believe she said she had called in answer to an ad in the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there an ad in the paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Ruby continuously run an ad for girls. After I got to talking
to her—it’s kind of funny as all get-out—getting ready to leave town the next
morning and then calling in in response to this ad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it you got the impression after talking with her for a
while that she really hadn’t called in response to that ad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I got the impression she was kind of a kook, in a way. I have
known of girls to do this, call up strange people and talk to them as long as the
person will talk to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you do that too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I have never done that, not that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So it was not your normal way of doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it was the middle of the night, Larry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why do you think you did that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just talked to her, somebody to talk to. I wasn’t sleepy. Somebody
to talk to more than anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You see the point—that that would be a story that would be much
easier to accept if the time element was not present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You must admit it is rather extraordinary for two strangers to
speak as long as you did on two separate occasions when apparently there was
no particular purpose about it, and no particular future to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I can’t explain it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she indicate that she was somebody with the Carousel operation,
what it was like?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; not that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she say what she wanted to do there, what kind of a job she
wanted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was a job for waitresses was what he run all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she mention that is what she was applying for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She mentioned the fact that she was calling in connection with
the ad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you must have asked her what she looked like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Oh, yes; I asked her for a general description of herself, measurements
and weight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us what she said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As far as I can recall, she give me her general height and
weight, color of her eyes, her hair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was all that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean you don’t remember whether she was a blonde or a
brunette?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe she said she had brown hair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then you do recall about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think that is what she said. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about her height? What mental impression did you form
as to what sort of a person she must look like?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. From the description she give me, I figured she must be a fairly
nice looking girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I judged that you had that impression. Did she have a good
figure?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. If I recall right, she more than likely must have had. That
is about 90 percent of a girl’s looks anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I figure that is about 90 percent of a girl’s looks, physical looks,
is her figure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean you are attentive to that sort of thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; like any other man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am not critical. It brings me back to the point that you said
you didn’t remember what she looked like. I suggest perhaps that you do. It is
a little bit more than you are telling us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I figured that she must have been a pretty nice—had a pretty
decent figure from her description and everything, or I wouldn’t have thought
she was a fairly good looking girl if she hadn’t give a pretty good description
of her figure. But as far as the measurements, I can’t remember the exact
measurements or anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But she was a brunette and she had a good figure. Did she
say anything about her weight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She must have been fairly light. It seemed attractive to me
because I like a smaller female. It must have been about 100 or 105, something
like that. But I don’t remember the exact weight or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you do remember that the weight was attractive to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It must have been light.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And therefore it was light. Are there any other preferences of
yours that would help us to determine that she told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I can think of, other than a good figure and a fairly
decent height.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did she describe her face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t really remember how she described her face, it has been
so blasted long ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When the first part of this conversation ended, did she tell you
she was going to call you back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I said something to her about calling me back if she
got the chance, or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she say why she had to end the conversation, the first
conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think she said something about the kids she was babysitting
with, or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean that she had to attend to them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that she had to end the conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. To tell you the truth what I thought, I kind of had the idea
all the way through it sounded to me like it was a bunch of older guys and
gals in the background giggling all the time. It seems to me like it was a dare
they had put her up to just to see how long a person would talk to her, or
something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then there were people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It sounded like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Other than babies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She kept saying she was babysitting with these kids and that
was all that was there was these young kids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you heard adults in the background?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It sounded to me like it was at least teenagers, kids at least
in their midteens, if not older, and I kind of had the idea that they had probably
put her up to a dare.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you were willing to go along with that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Sure; why not? I would probably never see her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you haven’t?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s put it this way: You may have met some girls since then,
but in any case those that you have met have not identified themselves or become
identified with that girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That would take us until about 3 o’clock in the morning wouldn’t
it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Right about that; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you asleep?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think I dozed off about then, and by then this call came from
Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That must have been between 3:30 and 3:45, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long after the call with the girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It wasn’t but about—it couldn’t have been more than a half
hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack indicate that he had been trying to get you but the
line had been busy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he want?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He wanted me to get dressed to meet him downstairs with
the camera, Polaroid Land camera, with extra films and extra bulbs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the camera you told us was previously used for taking
the pictures of customers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Taking the pictures of what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of customers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ask you whether you knew how to operate that camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think there had been some discussion about the camera on
a couple—on a previous occasion about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As a matter of fact, you had operated it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I had operated it at the club a couple of times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He knew you had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I think there was something said a couple of nights before,
something about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had taken pictures of the customers, as you frequently did,
to give them as they danced with the girls? And he knew that you had done
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, see; yea, he knew that I had done it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ask you if you knew how to operate one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He asked me if I knew how to change the film, that is what
it was. I told him yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So what happened then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. So I went ahead and got dressed. I had just got dressed and
got the film and bulbs and was starting to get the camera when this guy from
the garage called up and told me Jack was downstairs and wanted me to hurry.
So I went out downstairs and got in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was the guy from the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember what his name was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. A white man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was a white boy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. White woman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. White man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. White man. Did he telephone you or come up?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He telephoned up. He couldn’t have come up. The door was
locked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So Jack was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Outside in the car when I went down, Jack and George Senator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long was that after you had spoken to Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It couldn’t have been more than a half hour at the most, because
I hadn’t much more than got dressed when he called from upstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As I understood it, about a half hour after you finished talking
to the girl you were just about dozing when Jack called?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And said he would be right down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You got up and dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You fetched the camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the bulbs and the film?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you load the camera then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The camera was loaded.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was already loaded?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He knew it was loaded but nobody had any idea exactly how
many—we didn’t know for sure how many pictures were left in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you take some extra film?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was all there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. A roll of extra film.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All of that wouldn’t take a half hour, would it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I washed up, I imagine, before I got dressed. I usually did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you where you were going?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not until after we went out there. We took off and I said,
“Where are we going?” He didn’t say anything. He went on out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When he called by telephone the first time did he tell you where
he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know for sure. I don’t remember whether he did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know where he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I took it for granted he was at the home as far as I figured.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there anything that you now recall that would help you
remember as to whether he was calling from home or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; not that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So in fact you really don’t know where he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you think it was as much as a half hour after he called
that you got the call from the garageman to come down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he and Senator were in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Senator was in front?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; Jack and Senator were both in front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You got in the back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you drove off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is at that time I think you said you asked him what this
was all about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think I said something about where are we going.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He said “I want you to take some pictures.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And did you ask him where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was driving then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ask him of what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall if I asked him about what or not. I think him
and Senator were talking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember what they were talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Something about an ad, I think an ad, a sign or something like
that. When we got out there, it was “Impeach Earl Warren” sign at the
corner of the North Central Expressway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. North Central and Hall, I believe it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you describe this intersection that you think that you
took this <span class="locked">sign—</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was just like most of the expressway intersections are.
Around—come around under this bridge under an overcrossing and a road into
the side here, and another one comes square into it here over the other side of
the bridge. It was a building set in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me ask you this: How do you know it was the North Expressway
and Hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The sign on the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You saw the sign that said that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. We parked right beside the sign.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you have no questions about your memory on that? It was
next to a sign saying North Expressway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was on the North Central Expressway. I believe it was the
North Central and Hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You parked by the sign which designated both streets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe—yes; I believe that was the name of the streets. I
am not sure of the side street, but I believe it was Hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You drove out of town from the Carousel Club. Did you drive
north on the North Central Expressway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know which way. I don’t even know exactly which way
the North Central Expressway runs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you this: This overpass that was near the intersection,
did you go under the overpass before you got to the sign?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now the sign, was that located facing traffic that comes into
town or traffic that goes out of town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was facing traffic coming into town; I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And was there a place to park near that sign?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. On a side street that I believe is Hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could you pull off what you believe to be Hall Street, could you
pull off the road at that point and drive right up next to the sign?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There was a curb up—you would have to go over the curb to do
so, I believe. I think we parked along the curb here and got out and walked
across this open, small open space to the building the sign was on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How large was the sign?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was I think about 3-foot long and about the same height, 3
or 4 foot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what kind of a standard or support was it on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was on a building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It was actually plastered on a building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About how high up on the building was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I’d say about 5 or 6 foot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many pictures did you take?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I took three photographs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were those instantaneous print pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; 10-second Polaroid.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After you had finished taking them, what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We got back in the car and went back into town to one of those
cafes and had coffee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is the name of the cafe?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember the name of the cafe. I could take a person
right to it, but I can’t tell you the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How far away was it from the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About 2½ blocks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it would be south.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was it, on Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was half a block off Commerce, two blocks down Commerce
and half a block off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was Senator with you then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, the three of us were together. We went in and had coffee,
and I believe Jack showed the pictures to the man there in the cafe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did Jack say about the pictures at any time, commencing
from the time you took them <span class="locked">till——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There was some reference made between the address on the
pictures and the address on an ad he had saw in the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who made that reference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Ruby made the reference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the context of the reference, what the idea was
contained in his reference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The fact that there was quite a similarity—he said something
about the numbers were the same when turned around a little bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean that the <span class="locked">numbers——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. In the address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The numbers in the address of the sign of which you had taken
a picture were similar to those in an advertisement of some sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As far as I could understand, a hate advertisement that he had
saw in the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have that hate advertisement with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he express his thoughts as to what he proposed to do with
those pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He said something about going down to the post office and
checking this box number to see who had a box number, a certain box, or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Other than that, did he mention what he wanted the pictures for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I recall, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you stay in the cafe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We was there long enough to drink coffee, and that is about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That would be about how many minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Oh, maybe 20 or 25 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you go next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Then they took me over to the Carousel Club and dropped me off
at the Carousel Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. This was about 5, maybe 5:20. I’d say between 5 and 5:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I went back upstairs and put the camera up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think I picked up a book and read another book or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go to sleep?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Read a book or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go to sleep?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I wasn’t sleepy at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I said did you go to sleep?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; not that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is the next thing that happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About 8:30, I think it was, I called Jack. When I had been with
them I said something about dogfood, and Jack had said he’d bring some back,
so I called him about 8:30 and said—I guess I woke him up or something. He
was fairly shook up over the phone and chewed me out a little bit about waking
him up at that time in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you ever wakened him up at that time before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I had never called him before in the morning, like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What made you do so on this occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He wanted me to be sure and feed the dogs, and I didn’t have
any dogfood to feed them. He was usually up by that time in the morning, the
way he talked. He said he always got up at 7 o’clock every morning, and I called
him, figured when he did come down he could bring dogfood down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You expressed two thoughts a little while ago. I want to, there
again, get the factual basis for those thoughts or impressions. One, that he
was shook up, and the other that he chewed you out. Those are both impressions
that are based upon facts. What were the facts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, the way he answered the phone, he was kind of teed off, you
know, sort of teed off. He answered the phone in a grumpy way. He had never
spoke to me on the phone that way before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He just give me the daylights for calling him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did he give you the daylights?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember what he said exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he curse?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say that you were stupid? Did he use some words that
you didn’t like, that gave you the impression he was mad at you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember what he said, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, in any case, whatever words they were, they were not
polite?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Shall I put it that way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was his general way of speaking to me, more like—he talked
to me more like he always did with Andy, when he was mad with Andy, when
he was bawling Andy out for something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it the tone of voice more than the actual words?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was both. One thing his voice was very loud, and
he knew how that grated on me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He had talked to you like that before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. On one occasion, and I had stopped him. I told him I didn’t
like it. I told him if he wanted to talk to me, to talk to me, not to yell at me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long ago had that been before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just shortly after I went to work for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he had never done it since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But he did do it on this occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You also said that he seemed shook up, I think, or what were
the words you used there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That are used?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; that he used.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I think he said “shook up.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that he had chewed you out. I had asked you for a separate
basis of facts for both of those, both of those mental impressions you got. Is
your explanation intended to cover both of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About the only thing I could figure, it would be the same for
the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As I gather it <span class="locked">then——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was shook up, mad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was mad at you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is what I believe I was using the term “shook up” to mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was mad at you and he chewed you out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he mention anything about the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it simply that here was a man who had been asleep and
who had been wakened and he was mad because somebody had wakened him up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It could have been. That is what I took it as.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is what you took it as?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He used the tone of voice with you that he had used once before
which you didn’t like, and you told him about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He said something else. I don’t remember what it was he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was it like?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. How’s that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was it like in addition to this? Was it something particularly
more aggravating to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I would think it was pertaining to the President or something
there. I don’t remember what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, pass it. Perhaps we will come back to it in a little while.
How long did that conversation last, about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Maybe 5 minutes at the most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he say about the dogs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He said he would bring some dog food down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; he said, “When you come.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you when to come?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This you say was about 8:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About 8:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It lasted 5 minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had Andy come yet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. How’s that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had Andy come yet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; Andy wasn’t coming in. The club was closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The club still hadn’t been cleaned up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think I went over and had breakfast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Right away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Shortly after that. Within 10 or 15 minutes, it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were still dressed, I take it, because you had never undressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You hadn’t been to sleep at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You hadn’t been to sleep at all that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not very much, dozed off a couple of times or so, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean what with reading the book after you went to bed and
the telephone conversation, or both of them, with the girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then the visit outside with Jack and then going back and
reading some more, and then the call at 8:30, as I understand you, correct me if I
am wrong, you didn’t really sleep at all that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; that’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you go to breakfast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I went over to the Walgreen drugstore.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you get back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was gone about a half hour, approximately—probably 9:15 or
9:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. What happened then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I sat around the club there for quite a while. Then I decided to
leave, so I took off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you reach your decision to leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know. It must have been about 11 or 11:15, something
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any money?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I had $5, and that was it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you owed any money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Like I say, there was no—he had come to an agreement to give
me some money, but I didn’t know how much he had figured on giving me, or
anything. I think I took $5 out of the till, if I remember correct, and left a
draw slip in the till.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any money other than the $5?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think I had $2 in my pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you had $7, all together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where were you going?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I went to Michigan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you determined at that time that you were going to
Michigan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I had wrote to my sister quite a while before that, and
I had got no answer, and I had been worrying, wondering what the devil was
wrong there because she never failed to answer me right away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that the reason that you decided to go, to find out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was the only reason that I know of I was going.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I want to get at is what was your motivation for leaving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, I had been wanting to go up to Michigan to see my sister
and find out what was wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was the reason you went?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, then, this little rhubarb you had with Jack wasn’t the
real cause of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That had nothing to do with your decision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you leave any note to say what you were doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I left the key down with the boy at the garage, and told
him to give it to Jack when Jack come in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you leave any verbal message that you were leaving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think I told him to tell Jack I said goodby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Don’t you think you owed him more than that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I never stopped to give it a thought.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why didn’t you call him and tell him that you wanted to go
and see your sister?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know. I haven’t got any idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why didn’t you wait until he came in and tell him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I made up my mind to go, and that was it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you propose to travel that distance with $7?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Hitchhike.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you done that before in your life?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You told absolutely nobody but the garageman that you were
leaving; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right. He is the only one I spoke to. I gave him the
key and told him to tell Jack I said goodby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not tell him where you were going?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you in fact go? What route did you take?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I went out and took, I think it is 77, I believe it is—right outside
of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you walk there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I walked out about 15 or 18 blocks, I think it is, and a guy I
had met out at the fair picked me up. He saw me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you arrange for him to pick you up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; he was going by, he saw me, and he recognized me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. How’s that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember what his name is. He worked out there for
a while. I never did know his name. I don’t think he knew my name. He
recognized me as having worked out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were on the highway hitchhiking at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have a bag?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How large was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was a regular satchel and I had another bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What kind of a car was he driving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think he had a 1934 or 1935 Chevy, I believe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He had his son with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old is his son?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Nine or ten years old, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How far did you go with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He took me about 20 or 25 or 30 miles out. It wasn’t in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell him where you were heading?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I told him I was going up to Michigan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you discuss the route to go to Michigan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I knew the route I wanted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you looked it up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I had been across that route previously and knew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Hitchhiking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. My wife and I left Dallas in 1963. We went up 77 to 66.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you weren’t hitchhiking then, were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; we hitchhiked. She wouldn’t take the bus. I had money
for her to take the bus with her and the kids, and she refused to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You told us earlier you had gone by bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We went part way by bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which part did you go by bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We went I think from Sacramento, took the bus out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You hitchhiked to Sacramento?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We hitchhiked to Bakersfield, and picked up a motorcycle I had
there and went on the motorcycle. I worked in California there for about 3
weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you go by bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. From Sacramento we took the bus on up to Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you hitchhiked the previous time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. To Bakersfield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it was at her request? She wanted to hitchhike?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Rather than go by bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she give any reason for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She didn’t want to leave me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Didn’t want to what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She didn’t want to leave, let me go by myself or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you said you offered to take her by bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I offered to send her by bus and I’d hitchhike. That is what
I figured on doing. I had the money to send her and the two boys, but I didn’t
have money enough to take the bus myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So the three of you hitchhiked—the four of you hitchhiked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There were two young babies and you and your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any difficulty with that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. None whatsoever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now you have hitchhiked a lot, Larry—isn’t it true that it is
much harder for a group of people to hitchhike than an individual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It depends on the group. You take a group like that and it is
much easier for a family group like that to get a hitchhike than it is for a single
person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Oh, people seem to stop a lot faster for a family group like that
than they would for a single person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you had never hitchhiked north, had you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I figured to myself that we would take a route across from Dallas
to Amarillo, that that was a pretty hard route to hitchhike under any circumstances,
and figured that would be a lot easier, to go up 77 to hit 66, than
it would be to go through to Amarillo.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you consult a map at all in planning this trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We picked it up at the gas station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean after you started out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I picked up a map right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. In Dallas, Tex., about a block from where my wife and I had
been living.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am talking about consulting a map with reference to going to
see your sister when you left Ruby’s place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I knew that 77 would carry me right into 66, and 66 would carry
me almost in to Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t have to consult a map then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that what you are telling us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. This boy picked you up then and carried you about
30 miles, you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To what place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Out the other side of Carrollton a little ways.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What State?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he live there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He had a place there on the lake he was working on, he was
going out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What lake was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember the name of the lake.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But it was at Carrollton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Out the other side of Carrollton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How far beyond Carrollton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know. He went out and turned off on a country road.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But he left you on the highway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it a country road that went east or west of the highway you
were on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he went to the west, I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you how far he had to go up the road?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was going to work, is that it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. How’s that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was going to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was going to go up and do some work on his cabin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On his cabin on the lake?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did this man know Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could he have met Ruby as you did out at the fair?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He could have, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know that he did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you speak to him about what you had been doing in the
interim since you had last seen him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I told him that I had been working in Dallas at the Carousel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you mention that you had been working for Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I probably told him that Ruby ran the Carousel Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he show any signs of recognizing he had seen Ruby out
at the State Fair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or that he knew him in any other way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So far as you know then, the man didn’t know Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He gave no manifestations of knowing him at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, then. What happened next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I hitchhiked on up to Michigan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you wait for your next hitch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Oh, barely about 10 or 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The same spot or were you walking along?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I stayed right there, walked about a hundred yards, maybe,
up to an entryway where the cars came into the freeway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then you got another ride?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Got another ride, right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was that with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us something about him, what kind of a car it was, was it
a man, a woman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Oh, man; I believe it was a ride with a man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How far did you go with this second driver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Wait a minute, it was a man and his wife that picked me up,
carried me on up across the line, up to where he hit 66.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What kind of a car was it, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe they had an old Chevy, or an old Ford.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What license car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was a Texas car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And they carried you across the Texas line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. They was going up to visit some relatives of his up
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where? Is there a town at the Texas line that he dropped
you off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; it was on up about 50 or 60 miles across the other side
of the line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, I thought from what you said that he had dropped you
off at the line. In fact he had brought you about 60 miles beyond the line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And into what State?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was Oklahoma.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you ride with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We was together for about 5 or 6 hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time of day was it when he dropped you off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was night when I got off there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time had he picked you up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He picked me up about between 12:30 and a quarter to 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the town it was in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was one of the big towns there, if I can think of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tulsa, Oklahoma City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Oklahoma City, I think it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You rode in the back?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I rode in the front seat with them. They were driving the
car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I rode in the front seat with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The three of you in the front?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, they had stuff in the back seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I understood you to say that they didn’t tell you their
names at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. They give me their name, but I don’t remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But that they were going to visit some relatives in Oklahoma
City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. They was visiting his dad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. His father. And that would have been around 6:30 or 7 at
night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Right around there; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you have lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We stopped along the road at a cafe and had lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you stop on the road with the couple or with that friend?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. With the couple.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You paid for your own lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That I think was your first expenditure on the trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much did that cost you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Maybe $1, a dollar and a half.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you pay for their lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; they paid for their own.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, what did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. They let me out. I hitchhiked on up to Michigan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they leave you in downtown?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; they took me out to the edge of town to hitch a ride.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it in the direction they were going?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. They dropped by there, by his dad’s place, and we sat there and
we each had a cup of coffee and he took me out to the edge of town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you met his dad too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know what street that was on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know the name of the people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there anybody else there besides the father?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There was the father and one son that was at home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. An adult son?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was in school I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old a boy was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He must have been about 16 or 17.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We was there maybe a half an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And had coffee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No supper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then they took you from there to a spot on the highway on
the other side of Oklahoma City—that is, on the north side—did they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And dropped you off for your next hitch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long a drive was it to get you there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Oh, maybe about 4 or 5 miles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Miles you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The man and his wife or just the man?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Him and his wife, and I think his brother was with him, him and
his wife and his brother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They dropped you off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any suggestions made that you might rest overnight there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you did not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you get a hitch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Right away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Oh, I stood there maybe a half hour, 45 minutes, I was standing
under a street light.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you get supper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think I ate about 10 or 11 o’clock that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us about your third hitch, how long it was, and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it carried me through most of the night, through the
rest of the night I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it a man, woman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was a man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As far as I can figure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Maybe in his late thirties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What sort of an automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think he had a Buick.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the color?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the license, what State license?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Oklahoma.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you sit in the back or in the front?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I sat in the front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he carried you how far?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We traveled most of the night. He was traveling back east.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did he drop you off and where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think he dropped me off just the other side of Missouri, in
Missouri, just outside of St. Louis on 66.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which side of St. Louis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The south side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which way was he going?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That would be the west side of 66, of St. Louis, on 66. He was
going into St. Louis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was he going after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As far as I know, he was going back home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. East?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was going up on 66. So far as I know he was stopping in St.
Louis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I thought you said he was going east.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. From where he picked me up it was east, from where he picked
me up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I mean, was St. Louis his final destination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was it as far as he was concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say you had supper with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We stopped at about 10 or 10:30 and had a bite to eat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think we stopped at a truck stop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know what place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long after you had been riding with him did you stop?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He picked me up, it must have been about 8 o’clock, or 8:30.
We didn’t stop until about 10 or 10:30 for lunch, for a bite to eat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Two and a half hours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think you could have run a hundred miles or so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Easily.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It wasn’t a city which you stopped at?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, it was just a little truck stop on the highway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On 66?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you fall asleep there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I did, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At what time, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I have no idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are not sure then that you did fall asleep?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I fell asleep, but I have no idea when it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know how long you slept?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I slept until about a half hour out of St. Louis, when I woke up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you get to St. Louis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it daylight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much had you spent for supper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Maybe a dollar; a dollar and a half.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were down to about $4 then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Then I went on up. I got a ride there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you have to wait until you got that next hitch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Maybe a half hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us about that one; what time it was, what kind of a car
it was, the people in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I imagine it was a man alone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Don’t imagine if you can help it. If you can’t remember, but
try to recollect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I can’t recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How far did you go on that hitch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he carried me clear up into Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How far a run would that be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. How’s that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much of a run would that be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That would be about a 7- or 8-hour ride, driving time, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was daylight then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you were on that hitch about 7 hours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us whether it was a man or a woman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was a man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; most of your rides are with men alone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. A little while ago you told us that you didn’t know whether it
was a man or a woman or anything; you didn’t remember. Now you tell us
it was a man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then you really do remember that it was a man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As a matter of fact, I daresay you can describe him, can’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I can’t describe him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he a young man or an old man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he was in his late twenties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what about the automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It seems to me like it was a red and white Chevy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say you were with that person and in that automobile about
7 or 8 hours clean into Chicago. So you had a lot of opportunity to observe such
things as who you were riding with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It has been quite a while back, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it your memory that you now say he was a man in his late
twenties; about 29?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I would say in his late twenties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that you don’t remember the type of car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was a Chevy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t remember the State license plate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you do any stopping with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I imagine we probably stopped a couple of times and gassed up;
stopped and had a bite to eat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the cost of that meal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t. It couldn’t have been more than about a dollar
or a dollar and a half, at the most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t pay for his meal or buy the gas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it customary for hitchhikers to help out that way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not very often. A man usually figures if he picks up a hitchhiker
he figures on feeding him when he picks him up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. A man who usually picks up somebody who is hitchhiking, they
usually figure on feeding him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. These people didn’t feed you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. I try to have money in my pocket when I am hitchhiking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you get to Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What part of the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I’m not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would it have been early afternoon or getting toward dark?
This time of the year it gets dark early; it did at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say you had been with him about 7½ hours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me get the time straight here a little bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I thought we did have it straight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am not straight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me see if I can’t get this straight. You rode through the
night of the 23d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Until the man left you off on the morning of the 24th on the west
side of St. Louis on Highway 66; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was daylight then, and you had been with that man since about
8 o’clock the night before. Now, do you remember the time that he left you off?
I think you stated that, didn’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I’m not exactly sure what the time was. Probably about 6 or
6:30; something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then you rode with this other man from that time or about
a half hour after that time, you said; so that is about 7 o’clock on the morning
of the 24th, you rode with him about 7½ hours to Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About that; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So then we can reconstruct that you must have reached Chicago
or nearby Chicago at approximately half past 2 or 3 in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It must have been in there somewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you had stopped a little while for lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And gas and so forth. What do you think is the fair time to state,
Larry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. How’s that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What do you think is the fair time to state that the man let you
off in Chicago, given the time schedule that we have been able to work out to
the extent that it helps your memory? You were there. What we are trying to
do is to get the facts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It must have been about 2:30, 3 o’clock, because I got through
Chicago all right without any trouble.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He didn’t take you through Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I bypassed most of Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. On a couple alternate routes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With hitchhikers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Different rides.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Different rides?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I got three or four different rides in Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With these several rides around Chicago, bypassing it, how long
did it take you to get around Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Probably 2 or 3 hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And these were all short ones?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall your next long one that really took you out of
Chicago good?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I had a ride carried me over to Lansing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What distance is that from Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I’m not sure of the exact distance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did that man pick you up, a woman, or whoever it
was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was a man. It must have been getting on toward night; it
must have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Toward 9, or night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Night. It must have been getting toward dark. It was getting
dark pretty quick at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that man alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As far as I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you had that ride clean on from Chicago to Lansing, Mich.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you get to Lansing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, it was night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You weren’t at your destination yet, were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you stay in Lansing very long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; not too long. I had to pretty well walk through quite a bit
of Lansing; about an hour and a half walk, I guess it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. <span class="locked">Well——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You walked for an hour and a half?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you had two bags with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t attempt to take any streetcars or buses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No city buses running when I got there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you judge that it was too late for the buses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I think it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it after midnight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think so; I’m not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was a man, too, you think?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you have supper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think we must have stopped; I think we stopped before we got
to Lansing at a cafe to get supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How far out of Lansing? If you don’t remember the miles, you
might tell us about how long before he dropped you off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know that, either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It must have been 3 or 4 hours. Probably about halfway
between Chicago and Lansing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think you were with him about 8 hours, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think so; I’m not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he picked you up about dark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; that is about a 400- or 500-mile ride.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He picked you up about dark in Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just about toward dark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Five in the afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It must have been 5 or 5:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So it was something like midnight or shortly after when you got
to Lansing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you say about halfway between; that is when you had lunch
or supper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or about 8 o’clock, do you think; 9 o’clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It must have been about 8—8 or 8:30—something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you first hear that Oswald had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I had heard that Oswald had been shot Sunday evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It must have been while I was getting through Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you hear that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Over the radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What radio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The car radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know that Ruby had done it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I didn’t find out who had done it until the following Monday,
the following morning, Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you find that out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I heard that over the radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As a matter of fact, Larry, I suppose all of those cars you were
in had radios, didn’t they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. A lot of people don’t listen to the radio when they are riding
like that. That was the first I’d heard of it—was Sunday evening, the first
I heard Oswald had been shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Sunday afternoon, wasn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. How is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You said it was while you were working your way through
Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which took you two or three different cars; about 2 hours or so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was in one of those that you heard it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There was no announcement that Ruby had done it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe so, because I didn’t know Ruby had done it
until Monday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you find that out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I heard that over the news.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In a car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. During the night when you were driving from Chicago to
Lansing, during the period from 5 in the afternoon to about midnight, didn’t
you hear any radio announcements about any of this matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did that car have a radio in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Wasn’t it playing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you discuss the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. After I found out that Oswald had been shot we discussed it
a little bit. We couldn’t understand. Both of us, as far as I can recall—the
gentleman I was riding with and myself—we both said we would like to have
seen him come to trial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you mention to the man that you were from Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Isn’t it customary for hitchhikers to discuss what is a subject
common to them, and that is where you have been and where you are going?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Most of the time; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Didn’t you, in fact, do that with this man; tell him you were
from Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall whether I did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is a difference between telling us that you don’t know and
that you did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is what I say. I don’t recall whether I did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, really, it is not that you are saying to us that you didn’t,
but just that you don’t remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right, I don’t recall whether I had been doing so. I more
than likely did, because it is usually something that they say; it is a subject
that most people would discuss—where their destination is and where they have
come from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I would think that if you did, if there was a possibility
that you did, and you mentioned that you were from Dallas, that that would
be another topic of conversation that might be interesting between two people
riding along that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, that you had been in the city at which the
President was killed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We would have discussed that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Doesn’t that refresh your memory on the subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; it doesn’t, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You still don’t remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Talking to that man about the fact that you were in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember having any indication that it was known who
had shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you talk to anyone about the fact that it was a nightclub
owner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did the radio remain on after you heard this announcement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember whether the radio stayed on, or whether he
turned it off, or what.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case, what you are telling us—it is your best memory now
that you heard it over the radio that Oswald had been shot. That is as much
as you did hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not hear who had done it or even the type of person who
had done it, or what business the person was in who had done it, and that you
never discussed it with anybody that you rode with in any one of those rides in
Chicago and with the ride to Lansing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. So far as I recall, I don’t recall—I imagine it was discussed, but
I don’t recall discussing it. I don’t remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s put it this way: If you had discussed with anybody the
killing of Oswald, the man accused of killing Oswald, you would remember that
now, wouldn’t you, Larry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I would, if I discussed anything about who had been accused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span>
of it, but, like I say, the first knowledge I had of who had shot Oswald was
Monday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We will get to that in a moment Now, you had to go through
Lansing, and you say it took but an hour and a half?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your next hitch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As far as I can remember, I had a series of short rides, 20 or 25
miles to a ride.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How far along did these series of short rides take you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think I probably traveled about 60 or 70 miles before I got a
good ride.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That point, 60 or 75 miles beyond Lansing being the same point at
which you got a good ride, was what place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it a large city, a small town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was a small place as far as I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that the last hitch you had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I got one more after that. I think that one carried
me to Mount Pleasant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To Mount Pleasant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How far is Mount Pleasant from Lansing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I’m not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Perhaps we can get it by approaching the times. Apparently
you left Lansing about an hour and a half after you got there, after you got
there about midnight or so, and correct me if I am wrong. We could assume
that you left Lansing with a series of short rides which took you 60 miles, approximately
1:30 to 2 o’clock on the morning of the 25th, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, it must have been about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And would you care to estimate for us as to how long it took you
with the series of short rides to cover the 60 miles to which you have referred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It would be an hour and a half, 2 hours, 2 hours and a half.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Perhaps it would help if you look at it in this way. Do you
remember whether the next long ride that took you into Mount Pleasant you got
before or after daylight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was before daylight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was still dark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I walked about—where this guy let me off at it was about 5
miles from where there was any light and I walked up where there was light to
get a ride.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I didn’t quite understand that.</p>

<p>The man who picked you up 60 miles on the other side of Lansing let you
off before light?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I walked about 5 miles before I got a ride with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it light when you got a ride with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe so. I have lost some time somewhere between
leaving Dallas and getting there because I didn’t get into Clare until 9:30 at
night. It was 9:30 at night when I got into Clare.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At the present time, you are telling us that you picked up this
last long ride took you into Mount Pleasant. Let’s find out what time you got
into Mount Pleasant, because, you see, you told us you don’t know what place it
was where you picked up that ride, except that it was somewhat about 60 miles
on the other side of Lansing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir; I didn’t get into Clare until, I think it was 9 or 9:30
at night. I’ve lost at least 8 hours of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course I don’t know that you have because I don’t know
what geography or distance we are talking about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The distance isn’t that great. It only is 15 miles from Mount
Pleasant to Clare.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s start this way. What time did you get to Mount Pleasant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think it was about 8:30 at night when I got to Mount
Pleasant because it was 9:30, I’m almost positive it was 9 or 9:30 when I got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
into Clare, because I went over to my cousin’s house in Clare. I remember
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was before dark and before dawn when you picked up the
driver somewhere approximately 6 miles on the other side of Lansing who took
you into Mount Pleasant. Now, how long did you ride with him, and how far
is it between the two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is what I mean. I have lost some time earlier somewhere,
because it is not that long a ride. I could have made it from Lansing to Clare
and back again during the day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Larry, we want to get it straight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is what I am trying to do, myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If you want to figure out any place where you have made any
mistake about the <span class="locked">time——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is what I was trying to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We can start all over again. It seemed to fit as I went along,
but I wasn’t aware of the distances.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask him this question: I understand you said that you
walked through Lansing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did it take you to walk through Lansing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About an hour, hour and a half, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And at that time the cars were not running, the transit, the
public transportation was not running, or were you out of money at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I still had money I have to eat on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Lansing is how far from Clare?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Lansing isn’t over, I don’t believe it is over 225 miles from
Clare to Lansing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It may be that you are making a mistake, Larry. Let’s see if
we can’t refresh your memory from the time you got that last long hitch that
took you to Mount Pleasant because you remember getting to Mount Pleasant
at night, about 8:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that, you say, is a run of what—about 5 hours, 6 hours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe it would take that long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So if you got there at about 8:30 at night, then either you
didn’t get any hitches for a long period of time, or else something else happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I’m just trying <span class="locked">to——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Because you told us, and if it is not so, why we want you to
correct it. Everybody can make mistakes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is what I was trying to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You said that you picked up this ride at a point 60 miles
outside of Lansing and into Mount Pleasant prior to dawn on the 25th. Now,
maybe that is wrong. Maybe you got that ride late in the day. Let’s put it
this way. Was that a continuous ride straight on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It carried me straight on through to Mount Pleasant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you stop at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I can recall. It isn’t that long a run across there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you stop for lunch or anything of that sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it is about a 6-hour run?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t believe it is that long a run across there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If you got there at 8:30 at night, and if you are firm about
<span class="locked">that——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I’m positive it was 8:30 or 9 o’clock when I got into Clare.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am talking about Mount Pleasant. You had no difficulty getting
from Mount Pleasant to Clare, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you say an hour would suffice for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Plenty, plenty of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You got there between 8:30 and 9, that is into Clare, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s back off from there, then. Did you spend any time in
Mount Pleasant before leaving for Clare?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that you must have left Clare about 7:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I got into Clare <span class="locked">about——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean left Mount Pleasant about 7:30, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I left Clare—Mount Pleasant about 8 or 8:30. It was about
9 o’clock when I got into Clare.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you start on your way to Clare immediately after this man
left you off at Mount Pleasant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And had you run directly through without stopping from the
time the man picked you up and dropped you off in Mount Pleasant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right, 15 miles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. 15 miles? No; I am talking about the run <span class="locked">from——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. From Mount Pleasant to Clare.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; I’m talking about the run to Mount Pleasant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. From Lansing to Mount Pleasant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. A point outside of Lansing to Mount Pleasant. That is about a
4-hour run, you say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. At the most, from Lansing to Clare.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That last long hitch was about a 4-hour hitch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; the last long ride was maybe 2½ hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. 2½ hours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Or 3 hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was the man who brought you into Mount Pleasant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Mount Pleasant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Therefore, if you got to Mount Pleasant about 8, he must have
picked you up about 5 in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It must have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then there is some mistake in timing of about 12 hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is what I was saying. I’ve lost some time there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Perhaps it needs a little clarifying. Let me touch on another
point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It seems to me I got mixed up on my routes going out of
Oklahoma City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Think about it a moment and let me touch upon something else
before we go back to it. I think you said that you heard that Ruby had done
this on the morning of the 25th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, could you tell us how you heard it? Did you hear it by
newspaper, radio, television, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I’m not sure whether it was over the radio or whether I saw
it in the newspaper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, that must have made a terrific impact on you, because, after
all, that was your boss.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So I suggest that if you will just put your mind to it, you can tell
us pretty well how it was and where it was. Was it in a restaurant or an
automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think I saw it in the newspaper, saw something about Oswald
and then the assassination or something like that, and then I read the rest of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You bought a newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think so. I must have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Didn’t you keep it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t believe so because I didn’t have one with me when
I got into Clare.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it was morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; it must have been. It was about 8 in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. 8 in the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About that, somewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you with anybody, do you know?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I was walking through a small town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your reaction to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was pretty hard to believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell anybody about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think something was said to somebody I was riding with
about it or something. Somebody picked me up shortly after I saw it, somebody
I was riding with, and we had stopped in a cafe or something. I am
pretty sure I discussed it with the person I was riding with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are pretty sure now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The fact that I stated to him that it seemed almost impossible
to believe. It seemed to be awfully hard to believe it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell that person that you knew him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell that person that you had started to hitchhike up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I told him I had worked for him, that I had left the day after
Kennedy was shot, coming up from Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you with that person very long? Was he the one, for
example, who took you into Mount Pleasant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, let me see. I think you have refreshed your memory to
some extent. You tell us now you are quite sure it was a newspaper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am pretty sure it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That gave you the first information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I still think that—I’m almost positive I got mixed up on my
routes in Oklahoma City somewhere, or just out of Oklahoma City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We will try to straighten out that route business a little later.
You are quite clear that you arrived at Clare, Mich., about 9 o’clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that your destination from the start?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. My main destination was about Kalkaska, Mich.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How far is that from Clare?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It is about 3 hours running.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you stop on the night of the 25th, about 9 o’clock,
at Clare?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I stayed at my cousin’s at Clare.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your cousin’s name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Clifford Roberts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. 307 East Seventh Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were they expecting you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long since you last saw them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. At the time it had been, I think it had been, several years
since I saw him at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you know they were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. They wrote to my folks while I was living in Dallas, Oreg.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was <span class="locked">it——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Wait a minute; excuse me. I saw him before I went to work,
before I went to work with the carnival. My sister told me where they was
living at there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you intend to stop with him that night or just to visit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, I figured when I got in there at that time of night, I
knew what the road to Kalkaska was—it was pretty rough overnight, so I
figured I would stop. I would be perfectly welcome.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they recognize you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you talk to them about the Ruby matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. We talked quite a bit of it that night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the nature of the conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About the fact that I told them I had worked for him. It
was kind of a surprise to them to know somebody who worked for him; asked
me what kind of a guy he was, and everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. What I could, the best I could, what kind of a guy he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell them under what circumstances—did you tell
them the circumstances under which you had left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; told them how I had left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they express any surprise about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; because they knew me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They didn’t seem to be concerned about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There was my cousin and his wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just the two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. And their children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old are their children?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The oldest one, I think, is 7 or 8, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No friends came over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe there was anybody over that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did stay there that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you go to bed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It must have been about an hour and a half after I got there,
2 hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you slept through the night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you remain there the next day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I went on up to Harrison.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that in the direction of Kalkaska?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; along the best traveled road.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you leave Clare?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Probably about 9:30 or 10 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did your cousin Roberts know your destination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He knew where I was going to go on to my sister’s.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He knew you were going to hitchhike?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had he been in touch with your sister, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe he had been in touch with her for quite a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean, did he know she was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She might have told her that he was living up there—I think
mother told my sister where he lived, or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is the distance between Clare and your sister’s place in
Kalkaska, is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Kalkaska, about 100, 120 miles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that a rural community?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No cities along that route?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, there is one about 60 miles from it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is the name of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Cadillac. It is about 60 miles from Traverse City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have enough money at that time to get a bus ride in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had about $4 or $5 left, didn’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I had a couple of dollars left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. $2?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. $2 or $3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you attempt to borrow any money from your cousin to take
the trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he offer to give you any?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; he was in no position to. He had a large family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you make inquiry as to how much it would cost?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you said that you knew that that was a bad road for
hitchhikers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. At night, I said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is all right in the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Fairly decent road; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you make it that day into Kalkaska?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I went up to Harrison that day and spent a couple of hours
with an aunt I have in Harrison, and then went to Kalkaska.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is her name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Jean Eaton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is she married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is her married name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Eaton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see. Do you know her husband’s first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Ed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is he living with her so that it is Mrs. Ed Eaton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where does she live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know the name of the street she lives on. They get
their mail through a post office box.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You spent a couple of hours there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you hitchhiked there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How far is Harrison from Kalkaska?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About 90, 95 miles, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you get to Kalkaska that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall whether I went that night or whether I stayed with
my aunt and uncle that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We are talking now about Tuesday, the 26th of November.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember whether you got there Tuesday or Wednesday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember sleeping at your aunt’s house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I have spent on several occasions, I have spent the night with
my aunt and uncle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean on that occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember for sure whether I stayed with my aunt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I thought you said for a couple of hours there, and I was
wondering whether you had slept there that night. You said you visited a
couple of hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I went up there, I got up there before the kids come home for
lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you stay 2 hours or more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I spent the rest of the day there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And slept there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so. Then I went up to my sister’s the next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did anybody—did your aunt and uncle have a car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; he was working.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You weren’t able to get a ride?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; not with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had to hitchhike?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t even at that point consider bus travel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So then you got to your sister’s house on Wednesday, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what time of day?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It must have been about 2:30 or 3 o’clock in the afternoon, I
imagine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She didn’t know you were coming?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is in Kalkaska?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She lives about, I think about 20 miles out of Kalkaska, or
she did at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that when you got to Kalkaska you still had to go another
20 miles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About that, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was a rural road?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was about—most of it was a well-traveled road, one of the
main roads through the State.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From Kalkaska to where she lived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was then about two miles off the road.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She lives off the main highway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She did at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she live in a log cabin or something of that kind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She was living in a farm house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Farm house. About 20 miles from Kalkaska?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; a little place called Mancelona.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mancelona?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is in County Antrim; isn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell her about your experience?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was her reaction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, about the same as everybody else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she know about Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not sure whether she did or not. They didn’t have their
radio or TV either, so I don’t know. I think they had heard about it, but I am
not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, in any case, she didn’t know you had been working for him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it at that place that the FBI man interviewed you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What day was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is where he picked me up. He picked me up there on
Thanksgiving Day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did he pick you up? Did he arrest you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. They came out the house about 7 o’clock Thanksgiving
Day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. 7 o’clock at night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. In the morning, and he had me go for an interview.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was about 10 miles from there. It is a little town where the
police station was. I don’t remember the name of the town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know how they located you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. How is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know how they located you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, they went to my aunt’s.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did <span class="locked">they——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is one thing I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did they come to go to your aunt’s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. When I was in Dallas, I had got a letter from my cousin, and
I had left the envelope laying when I left there. They found her address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean Roberts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; my aunt’s niece, Mickey—my aunt’s daughter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is her name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Gail Eaton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She is the one who lives in Harrison?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She had written you or you had written her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I had wrote her, and then she had wrote me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The letter you wrote to her I don’t think you mailed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I mailed a couple of them. One or two anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you left one behind, didn’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I might have; I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what day they went to your aunt’s house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. From what I understood, it was the night before they talked
to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And she told them, I suppose, that you were going up to your
sister’s house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then the next morning they interviewed you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did that interview take?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About, I believe, 4½ to 5 hours I talked to the men there. That
is when they took me back out to the house, and then he asked me to go into
Kalkaska the following morning and meet him so he could take some pictures
with a Polaroid camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he did so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He took some pictures, and I talked to him between an hour
and a half and 2 hours again that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he go over with you the details of your trip up by hitchhiking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe he developed that too closely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever been interviewed by the FBI since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I talked to an agent last Saturday at my home in Dallas, Oreg.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Other than that you have not <span class="locked">talked——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think this man who had interviewed you, this FBI man who
interviewed you in Kalkaska, had asked you to keep in touch with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How was that to be done?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Dropping him a card or line letting him know where I was at
to get in touch with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is if you moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you stay with your sister?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was there a couple of days. Then I went back down to Clare.
I think I spent the night there, and then I was going to go to Florida, and I was
hitchhiking, and this guy picked me up, and he said it was pretty nasty out, and
he said it was too cold and nasty out to hitchhike. He said, “I have got a room
over here. I won’t be using it tonight, and you’ll be welcome to use it, and
then I will bring you back on the road in the morning.” I went out there with
him, and he was working with an oil field drilling crew, and one of the men
had quit, and they needed a man, so I went to work that night Then I worked
up until, with them up until, about the 17th or 18th of February.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The main office was out of Mount Pleasant, Michigan. We were
moving over the southern portion of the State of Michigan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you let the FBI know where you were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I wrote to them and told them they could contact me through
the North American Drilling office in Mount Pleasant, Michigan. When I left
there in February I went to Dallas, Tex. I was at the trial, and then I went
out <span class="locked">to——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you go to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I hitchhiked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why did you go to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was on a personal matter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I didn’t get that answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was on a personal matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was trying to locate my wife and children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was in February?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Let’s <span class="locked">see——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you said you worked for them until—we may be able
to clarify that. I just want to hit the highlights right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I left in March.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask this question. What is the name of the drilling
company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. North American Drilling Company. I spent a week or 2 weeks
around Clare there before I left. I believe it was in March, the latter part of
April.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are sure you got that job by accident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; it was purely accident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You stayed with them until February, as I understand it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I worked with them until about the 18th of February.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then you quit, or what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I had bought a rattletrap of a car, and we had moved locations,
and I had car trouble. I was staying about 40 miles from where we was working,
and I had car trouble and I missed out, I missed about five days of work,
and in the meantime they got another man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This drilling company was drilling for oil?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when did you get the subpena to appear at Ruby’s trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I got that in Dallas, Tex., at the courthouse, at the county
courthouse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, your trip to Dallas was not for the purpose of
attending the trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; not—mostly no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say not mostly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That wasn’t my main reason for going.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you been contacted by anybody to appear at the trial prior
to the time you left the North American Drilling Company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Eva Grant’s sister had wrote to my cousin, Mrs. Eaton, wanting
information as to my whereabouts so they could locate me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And she gave it to them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; she refused to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But your cousin let you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. They told me about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Then when I arrived in Dallas, I went up to find out what it was
all about. I didn’t know for sure what it was about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who did you go to see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I went to the courthouse, and then I talked—the first one I saw
was Andy. Then I talked to the lawyer, Mr. Phil Burleson, and he subpenaed
me then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what date was that, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. March 10, I believe it was; yes; it was on my birthday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did it take you from the 18th of February or so to get to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I stayed around Clare for, I think, a couple—a week or two. It
was, let’s see, it must have been about the 7th of March because I was only 3 days
going from Clare to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your purpose in going to Dallas was to try to find your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you succeed in that, by the way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You haven’t yet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you saw Burleson then, he told you he wanted you to
remain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he place you under that subpena?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they use you at the trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us roughly what the substance of your testimony was
at the trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. To the effect that I had took the pictures of the “Impeach Earl
Warren” sign and to the effect that he had only planned on shipping one of his
dogs to California.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is all that was brought out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That was about the main gist of my testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were a witness for the defense, I take it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you subjected to any cross-examination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think there were two or three questions put to me on cross-examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you get to talk to Ruby then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see Eva?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And Andy Armstrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. How is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Andy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I saw him before—I don’t believe I talked to him after I appeared
on the witness stand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was the first one you contacted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; he was the first one I saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In Dallas. Did you go over to the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. I went to the courthouse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you saw him at the courthouse?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Andy saw me; I didn’t see him. Andy saw me and he recognized
me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see. Who else did you talk to while you were in Dallas on this
last occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I talked to the Grants, to the Rubys—the brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I talked to them after the trial was over, after I had appeared
on the witness stand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t talk to them before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. I think I had saw Miss Grant one time, and at the time
when I did Burleson was standing right beside me when I spoke to her, let
her know I was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she know where you could be located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She didn’t know, but Burleson did. While I was in Dallas,
you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Burleson knew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Burleson knew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She didn’t call you to locate you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long were you in Dallas before you testified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Let’s see, I landed in Dallas on Sunday. I was in Dallas for
about 4 days all together before I testified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long were you in Dallas before you contacted Burleson or
met Burleson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I arrived in Dallas Sunday, and I contacted Burleson Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you testified on Thursday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you left on what day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think it was, I think I spent—let’s see, I left Dallas the following
Wednesday, I believe it was. I went to California where I stopped and
visited a very good friend of the family’s. I spent—I arrived there Thursday
night about 2 o’clock in the morning. He had just got home from work, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span>
then I spent Thursday night, Friday, Saturday night there, and then I left there
Sunday. They were making a trip up north, and they took me up north quite
a ways with them, and then I hitchhiked up home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you were in Dallas, Tex., where did you stay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I stayed at the mission most of the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What mission is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. City mission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where is it located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it is on Ervay Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean it is a religious organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Runs sort of a hostel or hotel <span class="locked">for——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Place for guys on the road to stay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you manage for money on your trip from up north
to Dallas, and Dallas on down west, and then again north to Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I had some money when I left Dallas, when I left Clare.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much did you have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. $40, $50, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you work at anytime after you left Clare?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Oh, no; I didn’t work after I left Clare.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t earn any money during that period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. I haven’t worked since about the 18th of February, I think
it is, at a job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who else did you see in Dallas beside the lawyers, Andy Armstrong,
and the Ruby family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I saw the people around the mission, and I say, I did work
1 day in Dallas, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where, and how much did you make?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I made about $7; I think I got about $7 out of it. It was out
of the labor pool.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much money did you have when you got to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was just about broke when I got into Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you manage to live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is why I said I stayed at the mission.</p>

<p>Mt. Hubert. It still required money for food.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It is a place where they feed you and they give you a place
to sleep.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did anybody in Dallas give you any money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. After I had appeared, after I had appeared on the witness
stand, Eva Grant gave me, her and her brother all together, I think gave me $8.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. $8?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right; all total.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the purpose of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Money to eat on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ask them or they asked you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. They asked me how I was living, and I told them, and I told
them—they give me money to eat on, and I spent Monday, Tuesday—Sunday,
I think Sunday, Monday and Tuesday night that I slept in the Carousel Club.
They gave me the key to the club so I could stay there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who did; Eva?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was the club in operation at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was after you testified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had it been changed from the time you had seen it before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There had been no redecoration or anything. I don’t think
they called it the Carousel. There was a Club de Copa or something, they had
run it a little while, and then they revoked her liquor license.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But the interior of the club, did you notice any changes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was the safe still there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was Andy; was he still there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; Andy was working some place else; I have no idea where.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you left, did you return the key to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see Ralph Paul or George Senator while you were
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I saw George Senator at the courthouse, that was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t see Ralph Paul or talk to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember seeing him. I know I never talked to him, and
I don’t remember seeing him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you talk to any of the strippers or the waitresses who used
to be there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Think hard now. Was there anybody else that you talked to
in Dallas outside of the people you saw in connection with the Ruby trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. These people that I saw around the mission there I talked to
is all, and the police department. I asked them to put a tracer on my wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see Mr. Case?</p>

<p>Air. Crafard. Case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Bob Case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You just arrived in Dallas from Oregon, I think when you were
served with these papers to come here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I had been home for a little while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I had arrived there, I had been there, let’s see, I got in Monday—it
would have been 2 weeks this last Monday that I had been home. I spent
my time looking for a job since I have been home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You haven’t found any yet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever been in trouble in your life in the sense of being
charged with any offense?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; sir, I have got two times that I have been picked up,
picked up on a vag charge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Vagrancy charge; Findlay, Ohio, and drunk in a public street
in Dallas, Oreg. That is the only two times I have ever been charged.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you actually prosecuted on those two cases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I paid a fine on the drunk on public street, and the other one
I was just—I spent 72 hours in the jail and was let go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The police have not reported to you on the tracer on your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was your wife last known to you to be in Dallas, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I didn’t know she was in Dallas. I had an idea she was around
the Dallas area somewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you left Dallas on November 23, did you have an idea
that your wife was around the area at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you come to believe that she was around the area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, I had wrote to my folks asking them for information,
if she had been in touch with them, if they knew where she was, and I had a
cousin who had been back out west and visited my folks and they told me, they
was telling me, they had gotten a letter from this woman in Cuba, Mo., where
my wife had been, so when I left Michigan, I went to Cuba, Mo., and I talked
to the woman there and, as far as she knew, my wife had went back to the Dallas
area, the last she knew of her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long had that been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It had been, this was Christmastime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is when the woman in Cuba, Mo., had seen her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That was the last time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were the children still with the woman in Cuba, Mo.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; the children was with my wife; she had the children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you didn’t contact her brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I tried to, but I couldn’t find out. Didn’t know where
he was living or had no way of getting in touch with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had he moved from the last time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The last I knew where he was at he was working on a ranch,
and I never could get ahold of the ranch. Nobody had ever heard of it out
around Carrollton, and nobody had ever heard of the place. I knew he was
there because I had been out there with him when he got the job, but I didn’t
have any transportation, so I had no way of going out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, you thought she was in the Dallas area. Where specifically
in the Dallas area did you have in mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There is a little place about 30 miles out of Dallas called, I
think, Greenfield, or something like that, that I was told she was around. She
had got a letter from her in that area in February.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. This daughter of this woman in Missouri.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did the woman, did she, show you the letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She couldn’t find the letter, she couldn’t locate it. She put
it up in some of her stuff and couldn’t locate the letter at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you check out around Greenville for her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I didn’t get out to Greenville.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you contact the Greenville police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell the Dallas tracer people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That the last you had heard she was in Greenville?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You didn’t know until you arrived at Cuba, Mo., that your wife
might be in Dallas, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So when you left Michigan on your way to Dallas you really
didn’t have any idea that your wife would be in Dallas. You expected she
might be in Cuba, Mo.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. When I left Michigan my destination was Cuba, Mo., as far as
I knew. As far as I knew, my wife was in Cuba, Mo., or around there some
place close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you left Cuba, Mo., the only information you had about
your wife was that she was somewhere near, might be somewhere in the vicinity
of Greenville, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Around the Dallas area is what—she had got this letter from
Greenville, and she was in the vicinity, as far as they knew, in the Greenville
area of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The letter was not written by your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; it had been written by my wife to this daughter of this
woman in Cuba, Mo.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What were you told the letter said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just, she just said, she didn’t say anything about what the
letter said. She just said it had been wrote from Greenville, and that this girl
had wrote back to my wife, and the letter had come back, nobody at that address,
no forwarding address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What direction is Greenville from Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is out sort of the northeast of Dallas, about 35 miles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What route is that on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not sure. I don’t think it is on a main route. It is, I
think, on a smaller highway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you ever heard of this place Greenville, Tex., before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I knew approximately where it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How had you happened to hear of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. When my wife and I were in Dallas, I had worked for this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span>
outfit that built these portable buildings and they built some over in that area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know of any friends your wife had in Greenville?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This letter that the woman in Cuba, Mo., received, did it give
any indication of how your wife was supporting herself or what her connection
was with the party that she was staying with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. To my knowledge, it didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The woman in Cuba, how did she happen to be friendly with
your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. My wife was on the road hitchhiking when she picked her up
with the boys. Her and her husband picked my wife up with the boys.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That was about 6 months—it would have been in the middle
of the summer last year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I mean, did your wife keep in contact with this woman from
time to time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. She left, the wife, the children with this woman for a
while, and she was getting a child-support check for her oldest son, my stepson,
and she turned the check over to the woman in Missouri.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did the woman come to know about your mother in
Dallas, Oreg.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I guess my wife said something about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, had the woman in Cuba, Mo., written your mother to tell
your mother that your wife had left, or something, or what was the occasion
for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe she wrote trying to find out what kind of a person my
wife was more than anything. I believe that was her main reason for writing
my mother. From the information I got from her, when my wife would come
back, my wife would be gone 2 to 3 weeks, she would come back at least once
a month with the check, to sign the check and turn it over to the woman, and
she said when my wife did come back she apparently did appear to have quite a
bit of money, and always had new clothes and real good clothes, but she said she
appeared—she did not appear to have a job of any kind, because of the fact she
would come back maybe on a weekend or maybe it would be in the middle
of the week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is the name of this woman in Cuba, Mo.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I can’t even remember right now. I have got it wrote down
in that little book, but I can’t even remember right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was it that the lady in Cuba last saw your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was Christmas Day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Cuba, Mo.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. She saw her Christmastime?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. My wife come back and got the children on Christmas
Day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. She also got a letter from her about that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The letter was received after that, I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When the woman in Cuba, Mo., saw your wife at Christmastime,
did your wife say where she was going?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As far as the woman knew, she was going to Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know a girl by the name of Gloria that was with
Ruby on November 20?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I couldn’t give you any particular dates, but I know a girl
Gloria that he took out, that he went out with a couple of times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is she the same girl as you have identified in this exhibit which
has been <span class="locked">marked——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. 5200-A, -B, -C, -D, and -E?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is Gloria McDonald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The last name is McDonald.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I didn’t know what her last name was, I couldn’t say, but her
first name was Gloria.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did she live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was either Oak Lawn, the Oak Lawn area, or the Oak Ridge
area, I am not sure which.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she live alone or with someone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As far as I knew, she was living alone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me ask when you say something like that, do you mean you
don’t know or you have some reason to believe she was living alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know, I will put it that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You really don’t know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Because the way you put it, you see, you infer she is living
alone, and if you really have no knowledge about it then you don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She was the girl that you had breakfast with one morning at
the Lucas B&amp;B; isn’t that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When, how long after you began to work for Jack Ruby, did
you become aware that Gloria was somebody whom he saw from time to time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe Gloria come to the club in answer to an ad, I am not
sure. But I believe that is where, how, I met her, when she come to the
club in answer to one of the ads we put in the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Along those lines now, is it your impression that Ruby didn’t
know this girl Gloria prior to the time she answered an ad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is my impression, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember when she came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But your thought is that Ruby did not know her prior to the
time that you went to work for Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is what I understood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When we say Gloria we are talking about this girl with the
striped dress you have identified in Exhibits 5200-A, -B, -C, -D, and -E; right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many waitresses did Jack employ at any one time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Counting the cocktail girls, there were about six or seven girls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, of these six or seven girls did any of them—were any of
them employed at the Carousel Club at the entire time you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Most of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many girls left his employ during the time you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe there was two or three left his employ, not counting
Jada, the stripper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember which girls left his employ?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. One I was with quite often there, we had meals together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was her name, again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember her name. I believe there was one other one
there. I would like to change one thing. The name you mentioned, the name of
that girl, I never did remember the name, the name Gloria. She worked as a
cocktail girl for 2 or 3 nights, and she never made anything at all, couldn’t make
enough money to buy cigarettes with, and she left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The girl in Exhibit 5200-A, -B, -C, -D, and -E was Gloria,
wasn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And she was there only 3 days?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She worked for him for 2 or 3 nights, and then she left. She
couldn’t even make enough money to buy cigarettes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But then she continued to see him on a social basis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was she working, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. How is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After she left him where did she go to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know whether she went to work or you just don’t know
anything about her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you any indication that Jack was supporting her in any
way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I have no idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When Jack placed these ads for waitresses, was it that he needed
help?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He had to run a continuous ad for girls. I think mostly he was
wanting to get girls to start them as strippers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And he would sort of start them out as waitresses first, is that
it, if they showed any <span class="locked">prospects——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He did with a couple of them, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about the waitresses, did he have some requirements for
the waitresses as to their looks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know. They were all fairly nice-looking girls, but I
wouldn’t say they were real beauties or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he provide them with uniforms?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About a week or 2 weeks before President Kennedy was assassinated,
he bought uniforms for the girls. But prior to that they hadn’t wore
uniforms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. They had no uniforms?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But they did have a common style of dress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Most of them wore slacks and a blouse or a sweater.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to mark this “Washington, D.C., Exhibit 5201, April
8, 1964, Deposition, C. L. Crafard,” and I will sign my name to it.</p>

<p>(Photograph marked Crafard Exhibit No. 5201 for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, Larry, I am going to show you what I have marked as
Exhibit 5201. You will notice the picture of a girl there, a brunette, scantily
clad. Is she wearing the uniform that you referred to that Jack bought?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize the girl in that photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever see anybody around the Carousel in an outfit like
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does that appear to be a picture of the inside of the Carousel
Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not as I know it, no. We didn’t have all this back bar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize anybody in that photograph, 5201?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. This man looks familiar, <span class="locked">but——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The man at the table looks familiar to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you probe your memory some and try to tell us why he
looks familiar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He looks like somebody I saw in the Carousel Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would he be one of the men from Los Angeles that you referred
to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It could be. I wouldn’t swear to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How often do you think that you saw that man around the
Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It wasn’t but a couple of times. It couldn’t have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that a picture of any club that you recognize in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. None that I have ever been in. I was never in any of the other
clubs except to the Carousel and the Vegas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you be sure that that is not a picture of any part of the
Vegas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, it is not a picture of the Vegas. They didn’t have a back
bar there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you see the man who appears to be a bartender in that
picture?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I should know him because it looks like—he looks like an older
fellow who was around the club quite often with Jack, but I can’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let the record show that the witness was referring to the picture
identified as Exhibit 5201.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember a fellow by the name of Ryan, who was
friendly with Jack Ruby, and who also went by the name of Roy William Pike?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. William Ryan is familiar, but this other man, it wouldn’t be
Mickey?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mickey Ryan. Is that Mickey Ryan that worked the bar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I couldn’t say. The picture is really—if I would see the man
and the picture together I might be able <span class="locked">to——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say the man in the picture, which man are you talking
about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The man who appears to be a bartender.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me see if I understand. Do you make some association in
your mind between the picture of the bartender here and the fellow you remember
as Mickey Ryan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. There is quite a similarity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you are <span class="locked">not——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know of a place in Dallas called the Gun Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I have heard mention of a place by that name, but I have never
been there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever meet any of Jack’s friends from Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me ask you a bit more about the man seated at the table in
the foreground of the picture identified as Exhibit 5201. Did I understand you
to say he bore a resemblance to someone you had seen before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that someone was who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I <span class="locked">don’t——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was suggested to you that it might have been one of the
people you identified as, earlier in this deposition as, having come from California
and as having come in to see Ruby on several occasions, and to sit down
and chat for a little while and then he would go off with them. Do you remember
that testimony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, is that man seated at the table as described by me a moment
ago possibly one of those men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It could possibly be, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is it about him that refreshes your memory so that you are
able to say that he could possibly be that man from California?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Mostly his face; his facial features mostly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Larry, did Jack Ruby know your full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did he know you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As Larry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he know your last name at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe so. I don’t recall telling him. I did—I told him
my last name when that letter came in from my cousin in Michigan, and he
gave it to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did Eva Grant know where to look for you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not sure except for the fact, like I say, I had left an envelope
with my cousin’s address at the Carousel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Andy knew your last name, didn’t he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did Andy come to learn your last name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe on this same occasion with the letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I asked you about the show “How Hollywood Makes Movies.”
What kind of a show was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That was, it showed a few of the different tricks and stunts
that was used in moviemaking process, such as shooting a mirror without breaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span>
the mirror, or shooting a glass off the bar counter, and how they broke a chair
over a man’s head and how a chair or table broke when a man was knocked
into it, such as that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many actors did they have in this show?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There was, I believe, six Hollywood personnel all together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did the show last in terms of each performance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The show was approximately about 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much did they charge for admission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe they was charging 75 cents, if I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who conceived of the show?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As far as I know, from what I knew of it, it was Craven and
Miles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What do you know about Craven, what was his background?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. All I know he come from Hollywood, was supposed to be some
producer from Hollywood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how about the Miles fellow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Deke Miles, as far as I know, was a director from Hollywood, a
Hollywood director.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you happen to decide to go to Dallas, Tex., in the fall of
1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Because I knew there was one of the biggest fairs in the country
held in Dallas, Tex., and I had some friends working over at Dallas, Tex., and
I figured this would be as good a place to get a job with a carnival as anywhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you happen to go to Dallas the first time you moved
there the year before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was going there to have a reconciliation with my wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you stayed about 3 months; is that it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you live with her at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Letot Trailer Park on Lombardy Lane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did one of you own a house trailer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We rented a house trailer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you drive an automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When Ruby bought the lumber from the dance-band show that
closed, what was he going to use that lumber for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Remodeling on the inside of his Carousel Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he use it for that purpose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did he do with the lumber?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He stored it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did he store it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Downstairs below the Carousel Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he make any effort to remodel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was doing some remodelling while I was there, building a
cloakroom. That was about all that was being done, building a cloakroom, while
I was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Jack Ruby ever away from his Carousel all day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember a day that I didn’t see him at least once during
the day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t, I say. I don’t remember a day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But ordinarily Jack would come about 11:30 in the <span class="locked">morning——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Stay just a short <span class="locked">while——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And would be gone all day until sometime in the late evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Usually; sometimes he would come back in the middle of the
afternoon for a little while, or maybe he wouldn’t come back until after the club
opened at 7:30.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">498</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did Jack actually have to do to manage the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That I couldn’t really say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did it appear he had very much to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As far as the management of the club, to my knowledge, it
shouldn’t have took him more than 3 hours a day at the most, that is, including
all the bookwork he would have to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he do the bookwork?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He kept a set of books, but he had a bookkeeper to keep his
books, an accountant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I mean—you mean he personally kept the books or somebody
else made the entries?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Andrew made most of the entries.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, during the 6 weeks or 2 months that you were there,
how many different strippers did he have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was mostly the same girls. He fired one and hired another
one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was the one that he fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was Jada.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And who did he hire in her place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Little Lynn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long after he fired Jada did Little Lynn come on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was 2 or 3 days between them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could there have been more than that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It might have been a week, I don’t believe so—I don’t believe
it was much more than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you present during the incident that resulted in the
firing of Jada?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe there were several different incidents that built
up to that event.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What were they, as you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know most of them, but the one instance I believe,
Jack shut the lights out on her as she went too far with her disrobing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And then did they have a fight of some sort afterwards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe there was; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I was in the club, but I don’t know—I didn’t know
what went on even.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long had you known Little Lynn before she was hired as
a stripper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I met her one day and she was hired the next
evening, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had Jack known her before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about her husband, Bruce Carlin, did you meet him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I met him at the same time I met Little Lynn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How often did Bruce use to come to the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. When Little Lynn went to work for the club at first he was there
almost every night—he was there every night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did he get along with Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I never seen any difficulty between them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How would you describe Bruce Carlin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He seemed like a pretty likable young fellow to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Slightly; not very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time would he generally come and what time would he
leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He would usually, when he come in, he would be there when
Little Lynn was on the stage, and he would leave, and she would go back in time
for her to come back on the stage, and he would come back in again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he and Little Lynn go out some place together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe they went out a couple of times between her acts.
I don’t remember.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Little Lynn remain around the club while Bruce was out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; most of the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long would you say Little Lynn worked for Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Oh, man; I believe it was 2 or 3 weeks. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So he had the same group of strippers except that Little Lynn
replaced Jada?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He had three different M.C.’s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And Billy DeMar was one of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And the M.C. is the same person as the comedian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about the band? Did he have the same band all the way
through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So you would say that while you were there there wasn’t any
other turnover in personnel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That you knew of.</p>

<p>I think you mentioned on two nights you ran the Vegas Club all by yourself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When were those two nights?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember the dates. It was during the week, week
nights. The one night I was the only one at the club, I didn’t even have a band,
all we had was the jukebox.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about the bartender?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was doing the bartending.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And taking the tickets also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We didn’t have any cover charge that night, just a jukebox and
beer. The next night we had the band, and I had a waitress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long was that before the assassination of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that was the week before, but I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was the reason that Jack didn’t have anybody to run the
Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The club wasn’t making any money. During the week it didn’t
make hardly any money, and that was the slowest night of the week for the
club, and his sister was sick one night, so he had me go over and run the Vegas
Club the first night, and the next night his sister was sick again, and I only had
the band and a waitress with me at night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was his sister in the hospital or anything while you were employed
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe she was. She was in the hospital—I think she was in
the hospital, but when, I’m not sure. I’m not sure whether she was or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see her after the two nights you worked in the Vegas
Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think I saw her over at the Vegas Club two or three nights
later, but I’m not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you meet Pauline Hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you meet a woman named Pauline Hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many times did you see her, would you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. All together I believe I saw her about four different times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you describe her physically?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Fairly nice looking woman, I would say maybe in her mid-thirties—a
little older, but a nice build, and what I saw of her, and when I talked
to her, she had a fairly nice personality.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there any woman at the Vegas Club who was employed
there who was noticeably heavy, who was fat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall of seeing one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about the Carousel, did he have anybody employed, any
woman employed at the Carousel Club who was noticeably fat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There was a colored woman by the name of Alice who more or
less took care of the coffee and the pizzas, was real heavy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you saw—do you know if Eva Grant worked at the Vegas
any nights after the two nights that you worked there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know anything about the man who runs the Colony Club,
Abe Weinstein?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I—I don’t. I believe I met the man on one occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you meet him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I met him at the Carousel Club. He was the one who
got—Jack hired Little Lynn through him. I believe it was that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were Jack and Abe Weinstein friendly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I wouldn’t say so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did Jack happen to hire Little Lynn through Abe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He needed a girl, and Abe had one that he didn’t need, and he
knew Jack needed girls through the union setup, so he told Jack about her,
brought her over and introduced her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had Little Lynn been a stripper at Abe Weinstein’s place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I understand she was an amateur.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever talk with Jack about the amateur nights that
Weinstein had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There was some—I wouldn’t say actually I discussed it with
him. I should say he told me about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did Jack tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, the fact that he—the unions had sent out an order for the
clubs to stop the so-called amateur night, and Ruby had done so, but the other
clubs in town hadn’t, and they had failed to comply with the union order, and
nothing had happened about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did Jack talk with you about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. When I showed up and went to work for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And, to your knowledge, did Jack do—what was Jack doing
about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was doing his best to get the union to force them to stop. He
had stopped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was he doing that you know of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was writing to some of the bigger, some of the higher officials
in the union, and friends of his that he knew that had position or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you you ever make any telephone calls for him or write any
letters or mail any letters in connection with that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I might have mailed some letters, I don’t recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about telephone calls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever drive Jack’s car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. At the time I was working for Ruby all I had, the only
license I had, was a restricted motorcycle operator’s license.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Other than that at that time that you—you had driven with
Jack, hadn’t you, in his car, a number of times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did Jack keep a lot of things in his car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. His trunk was always full of stuff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It was? How about the inside of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not so much in the back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What sort of things did he keep in the trunk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Pictures of girls, these twist boards he was pushing, and cards
for advertisements, and cards with the <span class="locked">picture——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you happen to see these things? These things in the
trunk of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I straightened the trunk of his car up several times at his
request.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he keep any keys in the car?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">501</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he had some in a box in the back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of keys were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. From what I could tell more or less house keys, keys for doors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were they loose or in a key chain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe there was a bunch of them on a keyring.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You say he kept them in a box of some sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of a box did he keep them in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just a cardboard box he had in the back of his car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he keep anything else in that cardboard box?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There was vitamin pills he was taking, and some of his diet
stuff he kept in that box. He always had a bunch of soap in the car, bar soap.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he travel out of town or something that would cause him to
need that stuff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why would he have kept those things in the trunk of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he keep clothes in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He sometimes would have clothes in the car. Maybe he would
put clothes in the car that he would take to the cleaner and they would be
in there 2 or 3 days before he would take them in the cleaners.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where would they be in the trunk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Right in the trunk of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about in the glove compartment of the car, did you ever
have any occasion to go into the glove compartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he keep the trunk of his car locked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And the times that you went into the trunk of the car, how did
you get into the trunk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. With the key.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where would you get the key?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He would give it to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he keep this key loose in his pocket or did he have it on a
key chain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He had it on a key chain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What else did he keep on that key chain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The keys for the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he had his apartment house key and the key to both
clubs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this actually a chain or a ring or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. A keyring.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. To your knowledge did he keep—did he have any separate set
of car keys that he kept on a separate ring or on a holder of any kind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You say at one time you went down to his car and got a gun
out of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did he keep the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He kept that locked in the trunk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever see any political literature of any sort in Jack’s
car or in the apartment or in the Carousel Club or any place else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I can recall seeing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever see any radio scripts of any sort that Jack had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have access to his office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did he maintain his desk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was pretty much of a mess most of the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this a desk that had drawers in it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how about the drawers, did he keep things in the drawers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, they was always full of stuff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever have occasion to go through any of these drawers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I went through, completely through the desk on different
occasions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall seeing any kinds of political literature of any
sort in there, and by political I don’t mean just partisan, but, oh, anything that
might have to do with any kind of issue or political philosophy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall it, of seeing any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever recall seeing anything from an organization called
Lifeline or that was a piece of literature that was put out by an organization
called Lifeline, or denominated Lifeline?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe there was a Lifeline book or magazine around once or
twice. I never paid no attention to it; saw the book and that was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever hear Jack talk about any public events?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. About all we would discuss would be the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What sort of person was Ruby as far as a person who talked
about what he was doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He didn’t talk too much about things, things he was doing, other
than the club itself. He talked about what had to be done about the club,
but other than that he didn’t talk too much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He didn’t tell you what he was doing outside the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So as I understand it, atypical for Ruby, he appeared at the club
before noon, wouldn’t come back until late evening, he would spend 8 or 10 or
what would presumably be waking hours away from the club each day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he ever talk about what he was doing during that period of
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever hear anything, or do you have any idea of what he
was doing during that period of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever attempt to talk to him about what he was doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About that time? Did you ever hear anybody else try to talk to
him about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know Jack, or see Jack, or talk with him often enough
so that you were able to form an opinion as to what Jack thought of his own
sexual abilities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I would have no opinion on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he ever talk to you about other than the incidents that you
mentioned earlier about his sexual conquests of his girl friends or something like
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Griffin, how about his efforts to keep in shape physically,
keep himself physically fit, and what not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I never saw any talk toward that effect. The only thing I knew
for sure was he was dieting and trying to lose weight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This is because he told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I saw him take these diet pills.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have some sort of a schedule that he would take this on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He took it every morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About what time did he take them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, the way I understood, about the first thing he got up
he would take this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would he take it at the club or at home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. At home; or sometimes at the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see him take it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">503</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was trying to take it—I guess he figured about noontime he
would take his medicine, this diet stuff, instead of eating.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did this come in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was in powder form, you use it in tea or coffee. It prevents
you from getting hungry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On the 22d when Jack came back after the President had been
shot, the first time, did he make any telephone calls to any of his employees,
to anybody, to people, to tell them not to come in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; he had Andrew make calls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Andy make all the calls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. So far as I know; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack—how about the newspapers, was anything done about
notifying the newspapers that the club was not going to be open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know as it was Jack who done it—there was—he done so
outside the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did anybody come to the club during the afternoon of the 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember of anybody coming to the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did any of the strippers show up that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember, I don’t recall any coming down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did Andy stay at the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was there until about 15 or 20 minutes after Jack left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The first time or the second?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The first time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Which means that he would have left sometime before 4 o’clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you and Senator and Jack went out to take the picture
of the Earl Warren sign, do you recall anything being in the car at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have any newspapers in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I couldn’t remember any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you sit, in the front or back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I sat in the back seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack know how to use the Polaroid camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It doesn’t take anything to run that Polaroid camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; but I don’t believe he had <span class="locked">ever——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it his camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was his camera. I don’t believe he had ever took any patience
to learn how to reload it. They can be quite complicated to reload if you
don’t know how to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have to reload after every shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much film did you have on there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was four pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That you took?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There was three pictures on it that I took. We thought there
was four, and there was only three of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you didn’t have to reload then, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I didn’t reload.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you all talk about when you drove out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. They were talking about this Earl Warren sign and a hate ad
that Ruby had saw in the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was Jack saying about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was something about the similarity of the numbers and
the addresses of the two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was Senator saying about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall what Senator said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you get some idea of what the purpose was, why Jack was
concerned about this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I was completely in the dark about it. Something, I
believe, was said about the sign of “Impeach Earl Warren,” business being
done by maybe the Birch Society or something like that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did Jack have to say about the Birch Society?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was either Jack or Senator said something about
this sign, the “Impeach Earl Warren” sign being—having something to do
with the “Birchites,” or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What were they going to do with this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I have no idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack say anything to you about what he had been doing
the rest of the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; that was early in the morning when we took the pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you hadn’t seen him for probably 12 hours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Before that, and in the 12 hours that he had been gone, did he
indicate or he or Senator indicate at all what had gone on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Something had been said about Jack not having gotten any
sleep.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack indicate that he was doing this for anybody else,
taking these pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; he didn’t give any indication about that fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Senator indicate what he had been doing that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was your attitude after you went out there on this picture-taking
enterprise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, it was just something he wanted done. It meant no
more to me than taking a picture at the club, actually, except I was kind of
curious as to what the devil it was all about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ask him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Something, they were talking about the “Impeach Earl Warren”
sign. I made some suggestion about a box number, “Write for free information”;
I made some suggestion about maybe writing for free information and
finding out what I had come back, as I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Nothing more was said about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was the box number written down or anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The box number was on the photograph, that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there a name on this, in addition to the box number, was
there a name to anybody that you should write to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think it was just “Impeach Earl Warren Committee” or something
like that. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You don’t remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Go ahead. You were going to say something else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was going to say either that or it was an organization in
Massachusetts somewhere or something that you had to write to. I know the
sign had been printed in, I believe, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What conversation did you have about this sign after you drove
back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. After going back in, we had coffee, and they said something
about going down to the post office and checking this box number to see if they
could find out who had the box or something, and they let me off at the Carousel.
That was the last I saw of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You mentioned in connection with that telephone call that you
had had, the 3-hour telephone conversation with that <span class="locked">girl——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You thought there were some people in the background.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you indicated you thought they might have been teenagers
or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there something particular about the voices and so forth
that made you think it was teenagers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, some of the giggles I heard were kind of silly, like some
silly giggle that some of the young teenage girls would do or make.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there anybody telling this girl to get off the phone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You also said something about the conversation was almost like
you had known this girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; it was. It was just the way we talked—I mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did she sound like she knew things about you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; but it was like people that has known each other for a little
while trying to get to know each other when talking, talking about their hobbies
and things they like and things they didn’t like, and such as that. It wasn’t like
two people who had just started talking over the telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was the voice one that you had ever recognized at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; the voice meant nothing to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I think you mentioned that Little Lynn called on Friday night
sometime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was it that you think she called?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe—I said I believe it was 9 or 9:30, I believed it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was it that she said when she called?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She wanted to get ahold of Jack, it was urgent or something to
that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did she indicate she knew the club had been closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; she knew the club had been closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And at that time did she know how long it was going to be closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You mean that you just don’t know or that you have the impression
she didn’t know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I had the impression she didn’t know any more about it than I
knew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was your impression?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That we would be closed Friday and Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Friday and Saturday. So her—when was this decision to close
Friday and Saturday, when was that made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Friday afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And that was made before Andy began to make the telephone
calls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So that anybody who had been called by Andy would have known
that the club was going to be closed Friday and Saturday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember closing the club on Thursday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. On Thursday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Thursday night is the night before the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; we closed at the regular time, the usual time, 2:30 or
3 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was done with the money that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe Jack had it with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, Friday morning was there any money in the safe when
you woke up, Friday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There was no money taken into the Carousel Club after Thursday
night, was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you indicated before that Jack had the practice of depositing
his money in the bank.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As far as I know; yes. That is what I figure he was doing anyway,
was depositing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any information he was doing that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I did not know definite, but that was what I figured he was
doing, keep it with him, and then every 2 or 3 days he said he would go to the
bank or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This North American Drilling Co., do you know anything about
the people who manage that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; all I know about it is originally it was the old McClure
Drilling Co. and the old Union Drilling Co. combined together to form the North
American Drilling Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were those Michigan companies or were they <span class="locked">people——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Michigan companies.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We will continue tomorrow morning at 9 o’clock.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
